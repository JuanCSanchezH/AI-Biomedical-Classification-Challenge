# Prompts Used for V0

> **Note:** Some prompts were created and used in **Cursor** and the others in V0

This document shows all the prompts used to guide the dashboard and interactive demo for classifying medical articles.

## Prompt 1 – Extract data

**Goal:** Extract data, structure and metrics to build vo visualization

```
Study all this project. Extract all insights and the most important metrics from the data output to create a file that contains the needed data to generate V0 interactive dashboards and charts. Also create a file that allows an interactive demo classification in real time using V0 (from Vercel). Save all these files and data into a new folder called V0_visualization
```

## Prompt 2 – Visualization

```
Act as a BI developer, I need your help to build the visualization for a challenge AI model classification developed in Python. The Python files and structures are located in the files provided, so study them. Think well and respond in detail to each step of the instructions before continuing to the next. Follow the steps bellow:

=== START OF VISUALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS ===
Before studied all provided files execute the next steps:
1. Create interactive dashboards and charts using the found data. Be creative and ingenious and don’t forget to show the most important metrics, analysis and graphics that shows the model performance and results. Includes inside any chart analysis a confusion matrix
2. Create an interactive demo classification in real time. It also must have client-oriented focus, understandable and creative interaction.
3. Verify if all the charts and dashboards contains data to visualize, important to procure no emptiness.
=== END OF VISUALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS ===
