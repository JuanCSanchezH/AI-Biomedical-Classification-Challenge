Cardiac arrhythmia detection using machine learning algorithms;This study presents a novel approach for detecting cardiac arrhythmias using machine learning techniques. We analyzed electrocardiogram data from 500 patients and developed a classification system that can identify various types of arrhythmias with high accuracy.;cardiovascular;cardiovascular
Neural network analysis of brain imaging data for Alzheimer's detection;This research investigates the use of neural networks for analyzing brain imaging data to detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease. We used MRI scans from 300 patients and achieved 88% accuracy in early detection.;neurological;neurological
Liver function tests in patients with cardiovascular disease;We examined liver function in 150 patients with cardiovascular disease. Results showed significant correlations between cardiac markers and liver enzyme levels, suggesting potential organ interactions.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular|hepatorenal
Novel chemotherapy agents for lung cancer treatment;A new chemotherapy protocol was tested on 200 lung cancer patients. The treatment showed 40% improvement in survival rates compared to standard chemotherapy regimens.;oncological;oncological
Stroke rehabilitation using virtual reality technology;Virtual reality technology was implemented for stroke rehabilitation in 80 patients. The system showed 60% improvement in motor function recovery compared to traditional rehabilitation methods.;neurological;none
Hypertension and cholangiocarcinoma: cardiac complications;This study examines cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplantation. We found significant cardiac complications in patients with pre-existing hypertension.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular|hepatorenal
Immunotherapy for advanced melanoma treatment;A new immunotherapy protocol shows promising results in treating advanced melanoma. The treatment achieved 45% response rate in clinical trials.;oncological;none
Epilepsy and cognitive function in elderly patients;This research investigates the relationship between epilepsy and cognitive decline in elderly patients. We found significant correlations between seizure frequency and cognitive impairment.;neurological;neurological
