Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report.;"Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy. In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.";neurological|cardiovascular;reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced tacrolimus pediatric heart transplant recipient case report;tacrolimus potent immunosuppressant frequently used organ transplantation however adverse effect include cardiac toxicity herein describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced tacrolimus heart transplantation hypertrophy caused clinical symptom noted elevation plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration confirmed echocardiography initially allograft rejection feared however myocardial biopsy sample revealed interstitial edema mild myocardial hypertrophy neither cellular humoral rejection detected blood tacrolimus concentration higher usual time thus tacrolimus dosage reduced myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing target concentration tacrolimus recur confirmed echocardiography myocardial biopsy thus conclude tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy patient receiving tacrolimus therapy blood concentration carefully controlled extreme attention paid cardiac involvement;reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced tacrolimus pediatric heart transplant recipient case report tacrolimus potent immunosuppressant frequently used organ transplantation however adverse effect include cardiac toxicity herein describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced tacrolimus heart transplantation hypertrophy caused clinical symptom noted elevation plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration confirmed echocardiography initially allograft rejection feared however myocardial biopsy sample revealed interstitial edema mild myocardial hypertrophy neither cellular humoral rejection detected blood tacrolimus concentration higher usual time thus tacrolimus dosage reduced myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing target concentration tacrolimus recur confirmed echocardiography myocardial biopsy thus conclude tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy patient receiving tacrolimus therapy blood concentration carefully controlled extreme attention paid cardiac involvement;neurological|cardiovascular;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Mutations associated with lamivudine-resistance in therapy-na  ve hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients with and without HIV co-infection: implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co-infected South African patients.;This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine-na  ve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in South African patients. Thirty-five lamivudine-na  ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co-infection were studied: 15 chronic HBV mono-infected patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The latter group was further sub-divided into 13 occult HBV (HBsAg-negative) and 7 overt HBV (HBsAg- positive) patients. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme. HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). HBV lamivudine-resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine-resistant strains in therapy-na  ve HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The HBV viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.;hepatorenal;mutation associated lamivudineresistance therapyna hepatitis virus hbv infected patient without hiv coinfection implication antiretroviral therapy hbv hiv coinfected south african patient;exploratory study investigate lamivudineresistant hepatitis virus hbv strain selected lamivudinena hbv carrier without human immunodeficiency virus hiv coinfection south african patient thirtyfive lamivudinena hbv infected patient without hiv coinfection studied chronic hbv monoinfected patient hbvhiv coinfected patient latter group subdivided occult hbv hbsagnegative overt hbv hbsag positive patient hbsag antihbs antihbc antihiv determined part routine diagnosis using axsym assay abbott laboratory north chicago serum sample pcr amplified hbv reverse transcriptase primer followed direct sequencing across tyrosinemethionineaspartateaspartate ymdd motif major catalytic region domain hbv enzyme hbv viral load performed amplicor hbv monitor test roche diagnostics penzberg germany hbv lamivudineresistant strain detected monoinfected chronic hepatitis patient hbvhiv coinfected patient best knowledge constitutes first report hbv lamivudineresistant strain therapyna hbvhiv coinfected patient hbv viral load monoinfected coinfected patient ranged copiesml respectively remains seen whether preexisting antiviral mutation could result widespread emergence hbv resistant strain lamivudinecontaining highly active antiretroviral arv treatment haart regimen become widely applied south africa likely potential implication management hbvhiv coinfected patient;mutation associated lamivudineresistance therapyna hepatitis virus hbv infected patient without hiv coinfection implication antiretroviral therapy hbv hiv coinfected south african patient exploratory study investigate lamivudineresistant hepatitis virus hbv strain selected lamivudinena hbv carrier without human immunodeficiency virus hiv coinfection south african patient thirtyfive lamivudinena hbv infected patient without hiv coinfection studied chronic hbv monoinfected patient hbvhiv coinfected patient latter group subdivided occult hbv hbsagnegative overt hbv hbsag positive patient hbsag antihbs antihbc antihiv determined part routine diagnosis using axsym assay abbott laboratory north chicago serum sample pcr amplified hbv reverse transcriptase primer followed direct sequencing across tyrosinemethionineaspartateaspartate ymdd motif major catalytic region domain hbv enzyme hbv viral load performed amplicor hbv monitor test roche diagnostics penzberg germany hbv lamivudineresistant strain detected monoinfected chronic hepatitis patient hbvhiv coinfected patient best knowledge constitutes first report hbv lamivudineresistant strain therapyna hbvhiv coinfected patient hbv viral load monoinfected coinfected patient ranged copiesml respectively remains seen whether preexisting antiviral mutation could result widespread emergence hbv resistant strain lamivudinecontaining highly active antiretroviral arv treatment haart regimen become widely applied south africa likely potential implication management hbvhiv coinfected patient;hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Myotonic dystrophy: evidence for a possible dominant-negative RNA mutation.;"The trinucleotide expansion mutation causing myotonic dystrophy is in the 3 untranslated region of a protein kinase gene . The molecular mechanisms by which the expanded repeat causes the clinically variable and multisystemic disease , myotonic dystrophy , are not understood . It has been particularly difficult to rationalize the dominant inheritance with the fact that the expansion mutation lies outside of the protein-encoding gene elements , and should not be translated into protein . Here we use muscle biopsies from classical adult-onset myotonic dystrophy patients to study the accumulation of transcripts from both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes in patient muscle , and compare the results to normal and myopathic controls . We found relatively small decreases of DM kinase RNA in the total RNA pool from muscle ; however , these reductions were not disease specific . Analysis of poly ( A ) + RNA showed dramatic decreases of both the mutant and normal DM kinase RNAs , and these changes were disease-specific . Our findings are consistent with a novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism for myotonic dystrophy  both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes are transcribed in patient muscle , but the abnormal expansion-containing RNA has a dominant effect on RNA metabolism by preventing the accumulation of poly ( A ) + RNA . The ability of the expansion mutation to alter accumulation of poly ( A ) + RNA in trans suggests that myotonic dystrophy may be the first example of a dominant-negative mutation manifested at the RNA level . .";neurological;myotonic dystrophy evidence possible dominantnegative rna mutation;trinucleotide expansion mutation causing myotonic dystrophy untranslated region protein kinase gene molecular mechanism expanded repeat cause clinically variable multisystemic disease myotonic dystrophy understood particularly difficult rationalize dominant inheritance fact expansion mutation lie outside proteinencoding gene element translated protein use muscle biopsy classical adultonset myotonic dystrophy patient study accumulation transcript normal expanded kinase gene patient muscle compare result normal myopathic control found relatively small decrease kinase rna total rna pool muscle however reduction disease specific analysis poly rna showed dramatic decrease mutant normal kinase rna change diseasespecific finding consistent novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism myotonic dystrophy normal expanded kinase gene transcribed patient muscle abnormal expansioncontaining rna dominant effect rna metabolism preventing accumulation poly rna ability expansion mutation alter accumulation poly rna trans suggests myotonic dystrophy may first example dominantnegative mutation manifested rna level;myotonic dystrophy evidence possible dominantnegative rna mutation trinucleotide expansion mutation causing myotonic dystrophy untranslated region protein kinase gene molecular mechanism expanded repeat cause clinically variable multisystemic disease myotonic dystrophy understood particularly difficult rationalize dominant inheritance fact expansion mutation lie outside proteinencoding gene element translated protein use muscle biopsy classical adultonset myotonic dystrophy patient study accumulation transcript normal expanded kinase gene patient muscle compare result normal myopathic control found relatively small decrease kinase rna total rna pool muscle however reduction disease specific analysis poly rna showed dramatic decrease mutant normal kinase rna change diseasespecific finding consistent novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism myotonic dystrophy normal expanded kinase gene transcribed patient muscle abnormal expansioncontaining rna dominant effect rna metabolism preventing accumulation poly rna ability expansion mutation alter accumulation poly rna trans suggests myotonic dystrophy may first example dominantnegative mutation manifested rna level;neurological;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Estradiol reduces seizure-induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats.;Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (SE). We compared the effects of 17beta-estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE. Rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta-estradiol (2 microg/rat) or oil once daily for four consecutive days. SE was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later. The extent of silver-stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE. 17beta-Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males. 17beta-Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3-C sectors of ovariectomized rats. In males, estradiol increased the total damage score. These findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on seizure threshold and damage may be altered by sex-related differences in the hormonal environment.;neurological;estradiol reduces seizureinduced hippocampal injury ovariectomized female male rat;estrogen protect ovariectomized rat hippocampal injury induced kainic acidinduced status epilepticus compared effect betaestradiol adult male ovariectomized female rat subjected lithiumpilocarpineinduced rat received subcutaneous injection betaestradiol micrograt oil daily four consecutive day induced following second injection terminated later extent silverstained hippocampal neuron evaluated day betaestradiol alter onset first clonus ovariectomized rat accelerated male betaestradiol reduced argyrophilic neuron cac sector ovariectomized rat male estradiol increased total damage score finding suggest effect estradiol seizure threshold damage may altered sexrelated difference hormonal environment;estradiol reduces seizureinduced hippocampal injury ovariectomized female male rat estrogen protect ovariectomized rat hippocampal injury induced kainic acidinduced status epilepticus compared effect betaestradiol adult male ovariectomized female rat subjected lithiumpilocarpineinduced rat received subcutaneous injection betaestradiol micrograt oil daily four consecutive day induced following second injection terminated later extent silverstained hippocampal neuron evaluated day betaestradiol alter onset first clonus ovariectomized rat accelerated male betaestradiol reduced argyrophilic neuron cac sector ovariectomized rat male estradiol increased total damage score finding suggest effect estradiol seizure threshold damage may altered sexrelated difference hormonal environment;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Mutations in the arginine-rich protein gene (ARP) in pancreatic cancer.;The ARP gene encodes a highly conserved arginine-rich protein from chromosomal band 3p21 . 1 1 . At the cytogenetic level this region is frequently deleted in a variety of different solid tumors , although not in pancreatic cancer . We have reported the presence of a specific mutation ( ATG50-- > AGG ) or deletion of codon 50 of the ARP gene in different tumor types ( Shridhar et al . , 1996 , 1996a ) . In the present study , we have observed mutations involving codon 50 in 11 of 37 pancreatic tumors . The frequency of codon 50 mutation is roughly the same in pancreatic tumors as in the other types of tumors previously examined . In addition , we have detected mutations at codon 51 in multiple PCR subclones in two other pancreatic tumors .

Fatal aplastic anemia due to indomethacin--lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro.;Although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established. A case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given. Indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. A positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient. Fortunately, this seems to be a very rare complication.;neurological;fatal aplastic anemia due indomethacinlymphocyte transformation test vitro;although indomethacin implicated possible cause aplastic anemia basis clinical observation role definitely established case fatal aplastic anemia described drug allopurinol indomethacin given indomethacin first given four week prior onset symptom positive lymphocyte transformation test indomethacin vitro substantiates potential role drug causing aplastic anemia susceptible patient fortunately seems rare complication;fatal aplastic anemia due indomethacinlymphocyte transformation test vitro although indomethacin implicated possible cause aplastic anemia basis clinical observation role definitely established case fatal aplastic anemia described drug allopurinol indomethacin given indomethacin first given four week prior onset symptom positive lymphocyte transformation test indomethacin vitro substantiates potential role drug causing aplastic anemia susceptible patient fortunately seems rare complication;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Germline E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and colorectal cancer .;"Inherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer . Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations . Therefore , we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations , by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences . Each family contained  ( i ) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric cancer . Novel germline CDH1 mutations ( a nonsense and a splice site ) were detected in two families ( 25 % ) . Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain . In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric cancer , a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years . We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations . However , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations . Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer . Thus , CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers .";oncological;germline ecadherin gene cdh mutation predispose familial gastric cancer colorectal cancer;inherited mutation ecadherin gene cdh described recently three maori kindred familial gastric cancer familial gastric cancer genetically heterogeneous clear proportion gastric cancer susceptibility nonmaori population due germline cdh mutation therefore screened eight familial gastric cancer kindred british irish origin germline cdh mutation sscp analysis exon flanking sequence family contained two case gastric cancer first degree relative one affected age year three case gastric cancer novel germline cdh mutation nonsense splice site detected two family mutation predicted truncate ecadherin protein signal peptide domain one family evidence nonpenetrance susceptibility gastric colorectal cancer thus addition six case gastric cancer cdh mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer age year confirmed germline mutation cdh gene cause familial gastric cancer nonmaori population however minority familial gastric cancer accounted cdh mutation loss ecadherin function implicated pathogenesis sporadic colorectal cancer finding provide evidence germline cdh mutation predispose early onset colorectal cancer thus cdh investigated cause inherited susceptibility gastric colorectal cancer;germline ecadherin gene cdh mutation predispose familial gastric cancer colorectal cancer inherited mutation ecadherin gene cdh described recently three maori kindred familial gastric cancer familial gastric cancer genetically heterogeneous clear proportion gastric cancer susceptibility nonmaori population due germline cdh mutation therefore screened eight familial gastric cancer kindred british irish origin germline cdh mutation sscp analysis exon flanking sequence family contained two case gastric cancer first degree relative one affected age year three case gastric cancer novel germline cdh mutation nonsense splice site detected two family mutation predicted truncate ecadherin protein signal peptide domain one family evidence nonpenetrance susceptibility gastric colorectal cancer thus addition six case gastric cancer cdh mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer age year confirmed germline mutation cdh gene cause familial gastric cancer nonmaori population however minority familial gastric cancer accounted cdh mutation loss ecadherin function implicated pathogenesis sporadic colorectal cancer finding provide evidence germline cdh mutation predispose early onset colorectal cancer thus cdh investigated cause inherited susceptibility gastric colorectal cancer;oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone.;Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias. The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels.

Lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast cancer patient with an impaired renal function.;A sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with cisplatin, developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide. Postrenal failure was excluded by echography. A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before anuria. However, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function. Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies. We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide, occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension. We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion.;hepatorenal|oncological;lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy breast cancer patient impaired renal function;sixtyyearold woman advanced breast cancer previously treated cisplatin developed irreversible lethal renal failure anuria day bolus ifosfamide postrenal failure excluded echography prerenal component could contributed renal failure transient hypotension due increasing ascitis occurring anuria however correction hemodynamic parameter improve renal function ifosfamide known nephrotoxic drug demonstrated tubulopathies strongly suspect lethal anuria mainly due ifosfamide occurring patient received previous cisplatin chemotherapy poor kidney perfusion due transient hypotension recommend careful use ifosfamide patient pretreated nephrotoxic chemotherapy inadequate renal perfusion;lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy breast cancer patient impaired renal function sixtyyearold woman advanced breast cancer previously treated cisplatin developed irreversible lethal renal failure anuria day bolus ifosfamide postrenal failure excluded echography prerenal component could contributed renal failure transient hypotension due increasing ascitis occurring anuria however correction hemodynamic parameter improve renal function ifosfamide known nephrotoxic drug demonstrated tubulopathies strongly suspect lethal anuria mainly due ifosfamide occurring patient received previous cisplatin chemotherapy poor kidney perfusion due transient hypotension recommend careful use ifosfamide patient pretreated nephrotoxic chemotherapy inadequate renal perfusion;hepatorenal|oncological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Pallidotomy with the gamma knife: a positive experience.;51 patients with medically refractory Parkinson's disease underwent stereotactic posteromedial pallidotomy between August 1993 and February 1997 for treatment of bradykinesia, rigidity, and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. In 29 patients, the pallidotomies were performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency (RF) method. Clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were carried out pre- and postoperatively. Mean follow-up time is 20.6 months (range 6-48) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year. 85 percent of patients with dyskinesias were relieved of symptoms, regardless of whether the pallidotomies were performed with the Gamma Knife or radiofrequency methods. About 2/3 of the patients in both Gamma Knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in bradykinesia and rigidity, although when considered as a group neither the Gamma Knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in UPDRS scores. One patient in the Gamma Knife group (3.4%) developed a homonymous hemianopsia 9 months following treatment and 5 patients (27.7%) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused postoperatively. No other complications were seen. Gamma Knife pallidotomy is as effective as radiofrequency pallidotomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Fluoxetine-induced akathisia: clinical and theoretical implications.;"Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. The typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced ""jitteriness"" may be identical.";neurological;fluoxetineinduced akathisia clinical theoretical implication;five patient receiving fluoxetine treatment obsessive compulsive disorder major depression developed akathisia typical fluoxetineinduced symptom restlessness constant pacing purposeless movement foot leg marked anxiety indistinguishable neurolepticinduced akathisia three patient experienced neurolepticinduced akathisia past reported symptom fluoxetineinduced akathisia identical although somewhat milder akathisia appeared common side effect fluoxetine generally responded well treatment betaadrenergic antagonist propranolol dose reduction author suggest fluoxetineinduced akathisia may caused serotonergically mediated inhibition dopaminergic neurotransmission pathophysiology fluoxetineinduced akathisia tricyclic antidepressantinduced jitteriness may identical;fluoxetineinduced akathisia clinical theoretical implication five patient receiving fluoxetine treatment obsessive compulsive disorder major depression developed akathisia typical fluoxetineinduced symptom restlessness constant pacing purposeless movement foot leg marked anxiety indistinguishable neurolepticinduced akathisia three patient experienced neurolepticinduced akathisia past reported symptom fluoxetineinduced akathisia identical although somewhat milder akathisia appeared common side effect fluoxetine generally responded well treatment betaadrenergic antagonist propranolol dose reduction author suggest fluoxetineinduced akathisia may caused serotonergically mediated inhibition dopaminergic neurotransmission pathophysiology fluoxetineinduced akathisia tricyclic antidepressantinduced jitteriness may identical;neurological;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease during valproate therapy.;"Valproic acid (VPA) is effective for the treatment of many types of epilepsy, but its use can be associated with an increase in body weight. We report a case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) arising in a child who developed obesity during VPA treatment. Laboratory data revealed hyperinsulinemia with insulin resistance. After the withdrawal of VPA therapy, our patient showed a significant weight loss, a decrease of body mass index, and normalization of metabolic and endocrine parameters; moreover, ultrasound measurements showed a complete normalization. The present case suggests that obesity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and long-term treatment with VPA may be all associated with the development of NAFLD; this side effect is reversible after VPA withdrawal.";neurological|hepatorenal;nonalcoholic fatty liver disease valproate therapy;valproic acid vpa effective treatment many type epilepsy use associated increase body weight report case nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld arising child developed obesity vpa treatment laboratory data revealed hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance withdrawal vpa therapy patient showed significant weight loss decrease body mass index normalization metabolic endocrine parameter moreover ultrasound measurement showed complete normalization present case suggests obesity hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance longterm treatment vpa may associated development nafld side effect reversible vpa withdrawal;nonalcoholic fatty liver disease valproate therapy valproic acid vpa effective treatment many type epilepsy use associated increase body weight report case nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld arising child developed obesity vpa treatment laboratory data revealed hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance withdrawal vpa therapy patient showed significant weight loss decrease body mass index normalization metabolic endocrine parameter moreover ultrasound measurement showed complete normalization present case suggests obesity hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance longterm treatment vpa may associated development nafld side effect reversible vpa withdrawal;neurological|hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Force overflow and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.;We assessed force coordination of the hand in Parkinson's disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy, particularly to levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). We studied two groups of Parkinson's disease patients with (Parkinson's disease + LID, n = 23) and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias (Parkinson's disease - LID, n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls. The motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa. A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON-state in Parkinson's disease + LID only. In Parkinson's disease + LID, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa (by 61%, P < 0.05). An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% (P < 0.05) and of static grip force by 45% (P < 0.01) was observed in the ON- compared with the OFF-drug condition. In contrast, no excessive force was found in Parkinson's disease - LID. Peak grip force in ON-state was 140% (P < 0.05) higher in Parkinson's disease + LID than in Parkinson's disease - LID, while static grip force was increased by 138% (P < 0.01) between groups. Severity of peak-dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON-state (r = 0.79 with peak force, P < 0.01). No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication. Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations. A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON-drug condition. We postulate that both LID and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations.;neurological;force overflow levodopainduced dyskinesia parkinson disease;assessed force coordination hand parkinson disease relationship motor complication levodopa therapy particularly levodopainduced dyskinesia lid studied two group parkinson disease patient parkinson disease lid without levodopainduced dyskinesia parkinson disease lid agematched healthy control motor score unified parkinson disease rating scale dyskinesia score force griplift paradigm assessed levodopa pathological increase force seen onstate parkinson disease lid parkinson disease lid force involved pressing object lifting significantly increased levodopa overshooting peak grip force static grip force observed compared offdrug condition contrast excessive force found parkinson disease lid peak grip force onstate higher parkinson disease lid parkinson disease lid static grip force increased group severity peakdose dyskinesia strongly correlated grip force onstate peak force correlation observed force motor score well daily dose dopaminergic medication force excess observed patient lid motor fluctuation close relationship seen overshooting force dyskinesia ondrug condition postulate lid grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanism related motor fluctuation;force overflow levodopainduced dyskinesia parkinson disease assessed force coordination hand parkinson disease relationship motor complication levodopa therapy particularly levodopainduced dyskinesia lid studied two group parkinson disease patient parkinson disease lid without levodopainduced dyskinesia parkinson disease lid agematched healthy control motor score unified parkinson disease rating scale dyskinesia score force griplift paradigm assessed levodopa pathological increase force seen onstate parkinson disease lid parkinson disease lid force involved pressing object lifting significantly increased levodopa overshooting peak grip force static grip force observed compared offdrug condition contrast excessive force found parkinson disease lid peak grip force onstate higher parkinson disease lid parkinson disease lid static grip force increased group severity peakdose dyskinesia strongly correlated grip force onstate peak force correlation observed force motor score well daily dose dopaminergic medication force excess observed patient lid motor fluctuation close relationship seen overshooting force dyskinesia ondrug condition postulate lid grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanism related motor fluctuation;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Extrapyramidal side effects and oral haloperidol: an analysis of explanatory patient and treatment characteristics.;The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with haloperidol. The incidence of parkinsonism was higher at higher doses of haloperidol and in younger patients. Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients. However, these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after parkinsonism developed. Akathisia was controlled by the benzodiazepine lorazepam in 14 out of 16 patients, while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective. The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to haloperidol.;neurological;extrapyramidal side effect oral haloperidol analysis explanatory patient treatment characteristic;incidence extrapyramidal side effect eps evaluated patient treated haloperidol incidence parkinsonism higher higher dos haloperidol younger patient prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication effective younger older patient however medication effective young old patient given parkinsonism developed akathisia controlled benzodiazepine lorazepam patient prophylactic antiparkinsonians ineffective present study point patient characteristic may significance development eps due haloperidol;extrapyramidal side effect oral haloperidol analysis explanatory patient treatment characteristic incidence extrapyramidal side effect eps evaluated patient treated haloperidol incidence parkinsonism higher higher dos haloperidol younger patient prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication effective younger older patient however medication effective young old patient given parkinsonism developed akathisia controlled benzodiazepine lorazepam patient prophylactic antiparkinsonians ineffective present study point patient characteristic may significance development eps due haloperidol;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a frequent cause of idiopathic Addison's disease in young adult male patients.;X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is a genetic disease associated with demyelination of the central nervous system , adrenal insufficiency , and accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissue and body fluids . ALD is due to mutation of a gene located in Xq28 that encodes a peroxisomal transporter protein of unknown function . The most common phenotype of ALD is the cerebral form ( 45 % ) that develops in boys between 5-12 yr . Adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) involves the spinal cord and peripheral nerves in young adults ( 35 % ) . Adrenal insufficiency ( Addisons disease ) is frequently associated with AMN or cerebral ALD and may remain the only clinical expression of ALD ( 8 % of cases ) . The prevalence of ALD among adults with Addisons disease remains unknown . To evaluate this prevalence , we performed biochemical analysis of very long chain fatty acids in 14 male patients ( age ranging from 12-45 yr at diagnosis ) previously diagnosed as having primary idiopathic adrenocortical insufficiency . In 5 of 14 patients ( 35 % ) , elevated plasma concentrations of very long chain fatty acids were detected . None of these patients had adrenocortical antibodies . By electrophysiological tests and magnetic resonance imaging it was determined that two patients had cerebral ALD , one had adrenomyeloneuropathy with cerebral involvement , and two had preclinical AMN .

Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats.;Reserpine- and haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia (TD) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress. In the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. Reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. Haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control. Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia. These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats.;neurological;acute reserpine subchronic haloperidol treatment change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake elicit orofacial dyskinesia rat;reserpine haloperidolinduced orofacial dyskinesia putative animal model tardive dyskinesia whose pathophysiology related free radical generation oxidative stress present study author induced orofacial dyskinesia acute reserpine subchronic haloperidol administration rat reserpine injection one dose mgkg every day day caused significant increase vacuous chewing tongue protrusion duration facial twitching compared control haloperidol administration one dose mgkg week week caused increase vacuous chewing tongue protrusion duration facial twitching observed four weekly evaluation treatment behavioral observation glutamate uptake segment brain analyzed decreased glutamate uptake observed subcortical part animal treated reserpine haloperidol compared control importantly decrease glutamate uptake correlate negatively increase incidence orofacial diskinesia result indicate early change glutamate transport may related development vacuous chewing movement rat;acute reserpine subchronic haloperidol treatment change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake elicit orofacial dyskinesia rat reserpine haloperidolinduced orofacial dyskinesia putative animal model tardive dyskinesia whose pathophysiology related free radical generation oxidative stress present study author induced orofacial dyskinesia acute reserpine subchronic haloperidol administration rat reserpine injection one dose mgkg every day day caused significant increase vacuous chewing tongue protrusion duration facial twitching compared control haloperidol administration one dose mgkg week week caused increase vacuous chewing tongue protrusion duration facial twitching observed four weekly evaluation treatment behavioral observation glutamate uptake segment brain analyzed decreased glutamate uptake observed subcortical part animal treated reserpine haloperidol compared control importantly decrease glutamate uptake correlate negatively increase incidence orofacial diskinesia result indicate early change glutamate transport may related development vacuous chewing movement rat;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rats.;AIM: Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined. The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin-induced epilepsy model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes. In group-1 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group-2 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was on (185 Hz, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following penicillin G injection intracortically. In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8  l saline injection intracortically. EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin-G injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum. RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin-induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity. In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges. These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with epilepsy.;neurological;effect hippocampal deep brain stimulation cortical epileptic discharge penicillin induced epilepsy model rat;aim experimental clinical study revealed hippocampal db control epileptic activity mechanism action obscure optimal stimulation parameter clearly defined aim evaluate effect high frequency hippocampal stimulation cortical epileptic activity penicillininduced epilepsy model material method twentyfive spraguedawley rat implanted db electrode group hippocampal db group hippocampal db sec following penicillin injection intracortically control group hippocampal db following saline injection intracortically eeg recording obtained minute following penicilling injection minute following stimulus analysis term frequency amplitude power spectrum result high frequency hippocampal db suppressed acute penicillininduced cortical epileptic activity independent stimulus intensity control group hippocampal stimulation alone lead diffuse slowing cerebral bioelectrical activity stimulation conclusion result revealed continuous high frequency stimulation hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharge result important term defining optimal parameter hippocampal db patient epilepsy;effect hippocampal deep brain stimulation cortical epileptic discharge penicillin induced epilepsy model rat aim experimental clinical study revealed hippocampal db control epileptic activity mechanism action obscure optimal stimulation parameter clearly defined aim evaluate effect high frequency hippocampal stimulation cortical epileptic activity penicillininduced epilepsy model material method twentyfive spraguedawley rat implanted db electrode group hippocampal db group hippocampal db sec following penicillin injection intracortically control group hippocampal db following saline injection intracortically eeg recording obtained minute following penicilling injection minute following stimulus analysis term frequency amplitude power spectrum result high frequency hippocampal db suppressed acute penicillininduced cortical epileptic activity independent stimulus intensity control group hippocampal stimulation alone lead diffuse slowing cerebral bioelectrical activity stimulation conclusion result revealed continuous high frequency stimulation hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharge result important term defining optimal parameter hippocampal db patient epilepsy;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent pilocarpine-induced seizures in the rat.;Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controversial. In order to elucidate this problem, we have studied the effect of long-term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures. Male Wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool. Thereafter, seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non-trained control groups. During the acute period of status epilepticus, we measured: (1) the latency of the first motor sign, (2) the intensity of seizures, (3) the time when it occurred within the 6-h observation period, and (4) the time when the acute period ended. All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus.;neurological;physical training decrease susceptibility subsequent pilocarpineinduced seizure rat;regular motor activity many benefit mental physical condition implication epilepsy still controversial order elucidate problem studied effect longterm physical activity susceptibility subsequent seizure male wistar rat subjected repeated training session treadmill swimming pool thereafter seizure induced pilocarpine injection trained nontrained control group acute period status epilepticus measured latency first motor sign intensity seizure time occurred within observation period time acute period ended behavioral parameter showed statistically significant change suggesting regular physical exercise decrease susceptibility subsequently induced seizure ameliorate course experimentally induced status epilepticus;physical training decrease susceptibility subsequent pilocarpineinduced seizure rat regular motor activity many benefit mental physical condition implication epilepsy still controversial order elucidate problem studied effect longterm physical activity susceptibility subsequent seizure male wistar rat subjected repeated training session treadmill swimming pool thereafter seizure induced pilocarpine injection trained nontrained control group acute period status epilepticus measured latency first motor sign intensity seizure time occurred within observation period time acute period ended behavioral parameter showed statistically significant change suggesting regular physical exercise decrease susceptibility subsequently induced seizure ameliorate course experimentally induced status epilepticus;neurological;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone-induced lung toxicity and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by a novel IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract.;"Grape seed extract, primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins, has been shown to modulate a wide-range of biological, pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective. This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) to prevent acetaminophen (AAP)-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone (AMI)-induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), GSPE alone, drug alone and GSPE+drug. For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/Kg GSPE for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (AAP: 500 mg/Kg for 24 h; AMI: 50 mg/Kg/day for four days; DOX: 20 mg/Kg for 48 h). Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues. Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation. Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence. GSPE+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE. Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. Additionally, this may have been the first report on AMI-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue. Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish GSPE's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.";neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;vivo protection dna damage associated apoptotic necrotic cell death acetaminopheninduced nephrotoxicity amiodaroneinduced lung toxicity doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity novel grape seed proanthocyanidin extract;grape seed extract primarily mixture proanthocyanidins shown modulate widerange biological pharmacological toxicological effect mainly cytoprotective study assessed ability grape seed proanthocyanidin extract gspe prevent acetaminophen aapinduced nephrotoxicity amiodarone amiinduced lung toxicity doxorubicin doxinduced cardiotoxicity mouse experimental design consisted four group control vehicle alone gspe alone drug alone gspedrug cytoprotection study animal orally gavaged mgkg gspe day followed injection organ specific three drug aap mgkg ami mgkgday four day dox mgkg parameter study included analysis serum chemistry alt bun cpk orderly fragmentation genomic dna endonucleasedependent independent addition microscopic evaluation damage andor protection corresponding pa stained tissue result indicate gspe preexposure prior aap ami dox provided near complete protection term serum chemistry change alt bun cpk significantly reduced dna fragmentation histopathological examination kidney heart lung section revealed moderate massive tissue damage variety morphological aberration three drug absence gspe preexposure presence gspedrug exposed tissue exhibited minor residual damage near total recovery additionally histopathological alteration mirrored serum chemistry change pattern dna fragmentation interestingly drug aap ami dox induced apoptotic death addition necrosis respective organ effectively blocked gspe since aap ami dox undergo biotransformation known produce damaging radical vivo protection gspe may linked inhibition metabolism andor detoxification cytotoxic radical addition presumed contribution dna repair may another important attribute played role chemoprevention process additionally may first report amiinduced apoptotic death lung tissue taken together event undoubtedly establish gspes abundant bioavailability power defend multiple target organ toxic assault induced structurally diverse functionally different entity vivo;vivo protection dna damage associated apoptotic necrotic cell death acetaminopheninduced nephrotoxicity amiodaroneinduced lung toxicity doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity novel grape seed proanthocyanidin extract grape seed extract primarily mixture proanthocyanidins shown modulate widerange biological pharmacological toxicological effect mainly cytoprotective study assessed ability grape seed proanthocyanidin extract gspe prevent acetaminophen aapinduced nephrotoxicity amiodarone amiinduced lung toxicity doxorubicin doxinduced cardiotoxicity mouse experimental design consisted four group control vehicle alone gspe alone drug alone gspedrug cytoprotection study animal orally gavaged mgkg gspe day followed injection organ specific three drug aap mgkg ami mgkgday four day dox mgkg parameter study included analysis serum chemistry alt bun cpk orderly fragmentation genomic dna endonucleasedependent independent addition microscopic evaluation damage andor protection corresponding pa stained tissue result indicate gspe preexposure prior aap ami dox provided near complete protection term serum chemistry change alt bun cpk significantly reduced dna fragmentation histopathological examination kidney heart lung section revealed moderate massive tissue damage variety morphological aberration three drug absence gspe preexposure presence gspedrug exposed tissue exhibited minor residual damage near total recovery additionally histopathological alteration mirrored serum chemistry change pattern dna fragmentation interestingly drug aap ami dox induced apoptotic death addition necrosis respective organ effectively blocked gspe since aap ami dox undergo biotransformation known produce damaging radical vivo protection gspe may linked inhibition metabolism andor detoxification cytotoxic radical addition presumed contribution dna repair may another important attribute played role chemoprevention process additionally may first report amiinduced apoptotic death lung tissue taken together event undoubtedly establish gspes abundant bioavailability power defend multiple target organ toxic assault induced structurally diverse functionally different entity vivo;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias during cesarean section after ritodrine therapy: interaction with anesthetics.;This case illustrates that patients receiving ritodrine for preterm labor may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of ritodrine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section. Such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular complications even after cessation of an infusion of ritodrine. Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum potassium level. Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible. Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of ephedrine are advised. After delivery of the infant, there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha-adrenergic vasopressor such as phenylephrine to treat hypotensive patients with tachycardia.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;ventricular tachyarrhythmias cesarean section ritodrine therapy interaction anesthetic;case illustrates patient receiving ritodrine preterm labor may risk interaction residual betamimetic effect ritodrine effect anesthetic cesarean section interaction may result serious cardiovascular complication even cessation infusion ritodrine preoperative assessment focus cardiovascular status serum potassium level delaying induction anesthesia considered whenever possible careful fluid administration cautious use titrated dos ephedrine advised delivery infant contraindication use alphaadrenergic vasopressor phenylephrine treat hypotensive patient tachycardia;ventricular tachyarrhythmias cesarean section ritodrine therapy interaction anesthetic case illustrates patient receiving ritodrine preterm labor may risk interaction residual betamimetic effect ritodrine effect anesthetic cesarean section interaction may result serious cardiovascular complication even cessation infusion ritodrine preoperative assessment focus cardiovascular status serum potassium level delaying induction anesthesia considered whenever possible careful fluid administration cautious use titrated dos ephedrine advised delivery infant contraindication use alphaadrenergic vasopressor phenylephrine treat hypotensive patient tachycardia;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Cardiovascular effects of hypotension induced by adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside on dogs with denervated hearts.;"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia. SNP is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK, and ATP is clinically used in other countries such as Japan. We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised. ATP (10 dogs) or SNP (10 dogs) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control. Before, during and after induced hypotension, we measured major cardiovascular parameters. Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped. Cardiac output did not change. During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped. Both ATP and SNP should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart.";neurological|cardiovascular;cardiovascular effect hypotension induced adenosine triphosphate sodium nitroprusside dog denervated heart;adenosine triphosphate atp sodium nitroprusside snp administered patient induce control hypotension anesthesia snp authorized clinical use usa atp clinically used country japan investigated two drug act cardiovascular system dog whose heart denervated procedure devised atp dog snp dog administered reduce mean arterial pressure control induced hypotension measured major cardiovascular parameter hypotension induced atp accompanied significant decrease mean pulmonary arterial pressure less central venous pressure less left ventricular enddiastolic pressure less total peripheral resistance less rate pressure product less total body oxygen consumption less heart rate less variable returned normal within min atp stopped cardiac output change hypotension produced snp similar decrease observed mean pulmonary arterial pressure less central venous pressure less left ventricular enddiastolic pressure less total peripheral resistance less rate pressure product less oxygen content difference arterial mixed venous blood less heart rate less cardiac output less increased recovery heart rate left ventricular enddiastolic pressure shown within min snp stopped atp snp act pacemaker tissue heart;cardiovascular effect hypotension induced adenosine triphosphate sodium nitroprusside dog denervated heart adenosine triphosphate atp sodium nitroprusside snp administered patient induce control hypotension anesthesia snp authorized clinical use usa atp clinically used country japan investigated two drug act cardiovascular system dog whose heart denervated procedure devised atp dog snp dog administered reduce mean arterial pressure control induced hypotension measured major cardiovascular parameter hypotension induced atp accompanied significant decrease mean pulmonary arterial pressure less central venous pressure less left ventricular enddiastolic pressure less total peripheral resistance less rate pressure product less total body oxygen consumption less heart rate less variable returned normal within min atp stopped cardiac output change hypotension produced snp similar decrease observed mean pulmonary arterial pressure less central venous pressure less left ventricular enddiastolic pressure less total peripheral resistance less rate pressure product less oxygen content difference arterial mixed venous blood less heart rate less cardiac output less increased recovery heart rate left ventricular enddiastolic pressure shown within min snp stopped atp snp act pacemaker tissue heart;neurological|cardiovascular;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Hypercalcemia, arrhythmia, and mood stabilizers.;"Recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia. A printout of all cases of hypercalcemia that presented during a 1-year period was generated. After eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non-lithium-treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions (group A) and 12 patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia (group B). Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies. Thus, two control groups were generated: group C1, which included age- and sex-comparable lithium-treated bipolar normocalcemic patients, and group C2, which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers. The electrocardiographic (ECG) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2. It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects. Patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects. Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2-year follow-up (28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.";cardiovascular;hypercalcemia arrhythmia mood stabilizer;recent finding bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy developed hypercalcemia severe bradyarrhythmia prompted author conduct retrospective study bipolar patient lithiumassociated hypercalcemia printout case hypercalcemia presented year period generated eliminating spurious hypercalcemia associated intravenous fluid author identified nonlithiumtreated patient hypercalcemia related malignancy medical condition group patient lithiumassociated hypercalcemia group patient group comparable group latter medically compromised receiving multiple pharmacotherapies thus two control group generated group included age sexcomparable lithiumtreated bipolar normocalcemic patient group included bipolar normocalcemic patient treated anticonvulsant mood stabilizer electrocardiographic ecg finding patient group compared patient group found group differ overall frequency ecg abnormality however significant difference frequency conduction defect patient hypercalcemia resulting medical disease bipolar patient lithiumassociated hypercalcemia significantly higher frequency conduction defect patient group significant mortality year followup contrast zero mortality three group clinical implication finding discussed;hypercalcemia arrhythmia mood stabilizer recent finding bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy developed hypercalcemia severe bradyarrhythmia prompted author conduct retrospective study bipolar patient lithiumassociated hypercalcemia printout case hypercalcemia presented year period generated eliminating spurious hypercalcemia associated intravenous fluid author identified nonlithiumtreated patient hypercalcemia related malignancy medical condition group patient lithiumassociated hypercalcemia group patient group comparable group latter medically compromised receiving multiple pharmacotherapies thus two control group generated group included age sexcomparable lithiumtreated bipolar normocalcemic patient group included bipolar normocalcemic patient treated anticonvulsant mood stabilizer electrocardiographic ecg finding patient group compared patient group found group differ overall frequency ecg abnormality however significant difference frequency conduction defect patient hypercalcemia resulting medical disease bipolar patient lithiumassociated hypercalcemia significantly higher frequency conduction defect patient group significant mortality year followup contrast zero mortality three group clinical implication finding discussed;cardiovascular;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Severe congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma: a case report.;This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy. Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3).

Effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. A hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic study in patients without heart failure.;The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, but have not been measured previously in man. We assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure. Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-SE) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed. The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+/-0.11 ml/s to 2.18+/-0.21 muscle-lengths/s (P less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility. No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients. No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients. We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal. Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. Nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism.;neurological|cardiovascular;effect ouabain myocardial oxygen supply demand patient chronic coronary artery disease hemodynamic volumetric metabolic study patient without heart failure;effect digitalis glycoside myocardial oxygen supply demand particular interest presence obstructive coronary artery disease measured previously man assessed effect ouabain mgkg body weight hemodynamic volumetric metabolic parameter patient severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure protocol long involved intervention might affect determination also studied nine patient using identical protocol except ouabain administration omitted left ventricular enddiastolic pressure left ventricular enddiastolic volume fell patient given ouabain even though initially elevated two patient left ventricular enddiastolic pressure fell meanse less left ventricular enddiastolic volume fell mlm less ouabain infusion completed maximum velocity contractile element shortening increased ml musclelengthss less consistent increase contractility significant change parameter occurred control patient significant change myocardial oxygen consumption occurred ouabain administration may related greater decrease mean arterial pressure ouabain patient control patient conclude patient chronic coronary artery disease clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular enddiastolic volume fall ouabain administration even initially normal though fall would associated decrease wall tension therefore myocardial oxygen consumption may sufficient magnitude prevent net increase myocardial oxygen consumption nevertheless compensatory mechanism prevent deterioration resting myocardial metabolism;effect ouabain myocardial oxygen supply demand patient chronic coronary artery disease hemodynamic volumetric metabolic study patient without heart failure effect digitalis glycoside myocardial oxygen supply demand particular interest presence obstructive coronary artery disease measured previously man assessed effect ouabain mgkg body weight hemodynamic volumetric metabolic parameter patient severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure protocol long involved intervention might affect determination also studied nine patient using identical protocol except ouabain administration omitted left ventricular enddiastolic pressure left ventricular enddiastolic volume fell patient given ouabain even though initially elevated two patient left ventricular enddiastolic pressure fell meanse less left ventricular enddiastolic volume fell mlm less ouabain infusion completed maximum velocity contractile element shortening increased ml musclelengthss less consistent increase contractility significant change parameter occurred control patient significant change myocardial oxygen consumption occurred ouabain administration may related greater decrease mean arterial pressure ouabain patient control patient conclude patient chronic coronary artery disease clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular enddiastolic volume fall ouabain administration even initially normal though fall would associated decrease wall tension therefore myocardial oxygen consumption may sufficient magnitude prevent net increase myocardial oxygen consumption nevertheless compensatory mechanism prevent deterioration resting myocardial metabolism;neurological|cardiovascular;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Associations of Ozone and PM2.5 Concentrations With Parkinson's Disease Among Participants in the Agricultural Health Study.;"OBJECTIVE: This study describes associations of ozone and fine particulate matter with Parkinson's disease observed among farmers in North Carolina and Iowa. METHODS: We used logistic regression to determine the associations of these pollutants with self-reported, doctor-diagnosed Parkinson's disease. Daily predicted pollutant concentrations were used to derive surrogates of long-term exposure and link them to study participants' geocoded addresses. RESULTS: We observed positive associations of Parkinson's disease with ozone (odds ratio = 1.39; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.98) and fine particulate matter (odds ratio = 1.34; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.93) in North Carolina but not in Iowa. CONCLUSIONS: The plausibility of an effect of ambient concentrations of these pollutants on Parkinson's disease risk is supported by experimental data demonstrating damage to dopaminergic neurons at relevant concentrations. Additional studies are needed to address uncertainties related to confounding and to examine temporal aspects of the associations we observed.";neurological;association ozone concentration parkinson disease among participant agricultural health study;objective study describes association ozone fine particulate matter parkinson disease observed among farmer north carolina iowa method used logistic regression determine association pollutant selfreported doctordiagnosed parkinson disease daily predicted pollutant concentration used derive surrogate longterm exposure link study participant geocoded address result observed positive association parkinson disease ozone odds ratio fine particulate matter odds ratio north carolina iowa conclusion plausibility effect ambient concentration pollutant parkinson disease risk supported experimental data demonstrating damage dopaminergic neuron relevant concentration additional study needed address uncertainty related confounding examine temporal aspect association observed;association ozone concentration parkinson disease among participant agricultural health study objective study describes association ozone fine particulate matter parkinson disease observed among farmer north carolina iowa method used logistic regression determine association pollutant selfreported doctordiagnosed parkinson disease daily predicted pollutant concentration used derive surrogate longterm exposure link study participant geocoded address result observed positive association parkinson disease ozone odds ratio fine particulate matter odds ratio north carolina iowa conclusion plausibility effect ambient concentration pollutant parkinson disease risk supported experimental data demonstrating damage dopaminergic neuron relevant concentration additional study needed address uncertainty related confounding examine temporal aspect association observed;neurological;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias.;"Primary dystonias are movement disorders with dystonia as a major symptom . They are frequently inherited as Mendelian traits . There are at least eight clinically distinct autosomal dominant and two X-linked recessive forms . In addition , pedigree analyses suggest the occurrence of an autosomal recessive variant . The clinical classification is increasingly being replaced by a genetic one . To date gene loci have been identified in at least six autosomal dominant forms , i . e . , in idiopathic torsion dystonia ( 9q34 ) , focal dystonia ( 18p ) , adult-onset idiopathic torsion dystonia of mixed type ( 8p21-q22 ) , dopa-responsive dystonia ( 14q22 . 1-q22 . 2 ) , and paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis ( 2q25-q33 ; 1p21-p13 . 3 ) . Gene loci in the X-linked recessive  forms have been assigned to Xq13 . 1 in the X-linked dystonia parkinsonism syndrome and to Xq22 in X-linked sensorineural deafness , dystonia , and mental retardation . The disease genes have been identified in two autosomal dominant forms and in one X-linked recessive form . Mutations in a gene coding for an ATP-binding protein were detected in idiopathic torsion dystonia ( DYT1 ) , and the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 gene is mutated in dopa-responsive dystonia ( DYT5 ) . In sensorineural deafness , dystonia , and mental retardation  , mutations were found in the gene DDP coding for a polypeptide of unknown function .

Locus heterogeneity in Friedreich ataxia.;Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) is the most common form of autosomal recessive ataxia . The disease locus was assigned to chromosome 9 and the disease gene , STM7 / X25 , has been isolated . To date most data suggest locus homogeneity in FRDA . We now provide strong evidence of a second FRDA locus . Studying two siblings with FRDA from two families we did not detect a mutation in STM7 / X25 . Haplotype analysis of the STM7 / X25 region of chromosome 9 demonstrated that the relevant portion of chromosome 9 differs in the patients . Although the patients studied had typical FRDA , one sibpair had the uncommon symptom of retained tendon reflexes . In order to investigate whether retained tendon reflexes are characteristic of FRDA caused by the second locus , FRDA2 , we studied an unrelated FRDA patient with retained tendon reflexes . The observation of typical mutations in STM7 / X25 ( GAA expansions ) in this patient demonstrates that the two genetically different forms of FRDA cannot be distinguished clinically . .;neurological;locus heterogeneity friedreich ataxia;friedreich ataxia frda common form autosomal recessive ataxia disease locus assigned chromosome disease gene stm isolated date data suggest locus homogeneity frda provide strong evidence second frda locus studying two sibling frda two family detect mutation stm haplotype analysis stm region chromosome demonstrated relevant portion chromosome differs patient although patient studied typical frda one sibpair uncommon symptom retained tendon reflex order investigate whether retained tendon reflex characteristic frda caused second locus frda studied unrelated frda patient retained tendon reflex observation typical mutation stm gaa expansion patient demonstrates two genetically different form frda distinguished clinically;locus heterogeneity friedreich ataxia friedreich ataxia frda common form autosomal recessive ataxia disease locus assigned chromosome disease gene stm isolated date data suggest locus homogeneity frda provide strong evidence second frda locus studying two sibling frda two family detect mutation stm haplotype analysis stm region chromosome demonstrated relevant portion chromosome differs patient although patient studied typical frda one sibpair uncommon symptom retained tendon reflex order investigate whether retained tendon reflex characteristic frda caused second locus frda studied unrelated frda patient retained tendon reflex observation typical mutation stm gaa expansion patient demonstrates two genetically different form frda distinguished clinically;neurological;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Medial changes in arterial spasm induced by L-norepinephrine.;In normal rats, the media of small arteries (0.4--0.2 mm in diameter) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles, identified ultrastructurally as herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another. The hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been tested. In the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch, vasoconstriction induced by L-norepinephrine produced many cell-to-cell hernias within 15 minutes. At 1 day their number was reduced to about 1/10 of the original number. By 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal. Triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the media. These findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function. The experimental data are discussed in relation to medial changes observed in other instances of arterial spasm. Endothelial changes that developed in the same experimental model were described in a previous paper.;cardiovascular;medial change arterial spasm induced lnorepinephrine;normal rat medium small artery diameter previously shown contain intracellular vacuole identified ultrastructurally herniation one smooth muscle cell another hypothesis intense vasoconstriction would increase number vacuole tested medium saphenous artery distal branch vasoconstriction induced lnorepinephrine produced many celltocell hernia within minute day number reduced original number day vessel almost restored normal triple stimulation day induced severe change medium finding suggest smooth muscle cell susceptible damage course specific function experimental data discussed relation medial change observed instance arterial spasm endothelial change developed experimental model described previous paper;medial change arterial spasm induced lnorepinephrine normal rat medium small artery diameter previously shown contain intracellular vacuole identified ultrastructurally herniation one smooth muscle cell another hypothesis intense vasoconstriction would increase number vacuole tested medium saphenous artery distal branch vasoconstriction induced lnorepinephrine produced many celltocell hernia within minute day number reduced original number day vessel almost restored normal triple stimulation day induced severe change medium finding suggest smooth muscle cell susceptible damage course specific function experimental data discussed relation medial change observed instance arterial spasm endothelial change developed experimental model described previous paper;cardiovascular;hepatorenal|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Learning of rats under amnesia caused by pentobarbital.;Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of amnesia produced by pentobarbital (15 mg/kg, ip) was carried out. Rats were trained to approach a shelf where they received food reinforcement. In Group 1 the rats were trained under the influence of pentobarbital to run to the same shelf as in the normal state. In Group 2 the rats were trained to approach different shelves in different drug states. It was shown that memory dissociation occurred in both groups. Differences in the parameters of training under the influence of pentobarbital between Groups 1 and 2 were revealed. These findings show that the brain-dissociated state induced by pentobarbital is formed with the participation of the mechanisms of information perception.;neurological;learning rat amnesia caused pentobarbital;dissociated learning rat normal state state amnesia produced pentobarbital mgkg carried rat trained approach shelf received food reinforcement group rat trained influence pentobarbital run shelf normal state group rat trained approach different shelf different drug state shown memory dissociation occurred group difference parameter training influence pentobarbital group revealed finding show braindissociated state induced pentobarbital formed participation mechanism information perception;learning rat amnesia caused pentobarbital dissociated learning rat normal state state amnesia produced pentobarbital mgkg carried rat trained approach shelf received food reinforcement group rat trained influence pentobarbital run shelf normal state group rat trained approach different shelf different drug state shown memory dissociation occurred group difference parameter training influence pentobarbital group revealed finding show braindissociated state induced pentobarbital formed participation mechanism information perception;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

atm and p53 cooperate in apoptosis and suppression of tumorigenesis, but not in resistance to acute radiation toxicity.;Mutations in atm and p53 cause the human cancer-associated diseases ataxia-telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome , respectively . The two genes are believed to interact in a number of pathways , including regulation of DNA damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints , apoptosis and radiation sensitivity , and cellular proliferation . Atm-null mice , as well as those null for p53 , develop mainly T-cell lymphomas , supporting the view that these genes have similar roles in thymocyte development . To study the interactions of these two genes on an organismal level , we bred mice heterozygous for null alleles of both atm and p53 to produce all genotypic combinations . Mice doubly null for atm and p53 exhibited a dramatic acceleration of tumour formation relative to singly null mice , indicating that both genes collaborate in a significant manner to prevent tumorigenesis .

Increased incidence of cancer in patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia .;OBJECTIVE  Previous reports have suggested an increased risk of cancer among patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) . This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first-degree relatives . STUDY DESIGN  One hundred twenty-two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986 . Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center . This cohort underwent follow-up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995 . RESULTS  A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH ( standardized incidence ratio 6 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval 2 . 3 to 16 ) , which was mainly attributable to non-Hodgkins lymphoma  ( standardized incidence ratio 90 , 95 % confidence interval 18 to 264 ) . In addition , a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen ( standardized incidence ratio 35 , 95 % confidence interval 7 . 2 to 102 ) . The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population .

Ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism.;In a 12-week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients. Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine, their previous antiparkinsonian drug. However, benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment, and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients. This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonian symptoms, because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect.;neurological;ethopropazine benztropine neurolepticinduced parkinsonism;week controlled study ethopropazine compared benztropine treatment parkinsonism induced fluphenazine enanthate schizophrenic outpatient ethopropazine benztropine found equally effective controlling parkinsonian symptom efficacious procyclidine previous antiparkinsonian drug however benztropine treated patient significant increase tardive dyskinesia compared condition procyclindine treatment significantly anxiety depression ethopropazine treated patient suggests benztropine anticholinergic drug choice treatment neurolepticinduced parkinsonian symptom toxic central peripheral atropinic effect;ethopropazine benztropine neurolepticinduced parkinsonism week controlled study ethopropazine compared benztropine treatment parkinsonism induced fluphenazine enanthate schizophrenic outpatient ethopropazine benztropine found equally effective controlling parkinsonian symptom efficacious procyclidine previous antiparkinsonian drug however benztropine treated patient significant increase tardive dyskinesia compared condition procyclindine treatment significantly anxiety depression ethopropazine treated patient suggests benztropine anticholinergic drug choice treatment neurolepticinduced parkinsonian symptom toxic central peripheral atropinic effect;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and methylphenidate.;A 1-year-old female presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate. She had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum (multicystic encephalomalacia) due to severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome. However, methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine, and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem (mainly the midbrain) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome. A relative gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic deficiency might occur because diazepam, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-mimetic agent, was strikingly effective. This is the first reported patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate.;neurological;neuroleptic malignant syndrome methylphenidate;yearold female presented neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused methylphenidate defect supratentorial brain including basal ganglion striatum multicystic encephalomalacia due severe perinatal hypoxicischemic encephalopathy considered possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally accepted pathogenesis syndrome however methylphenidate dopamine agonist via inhibition uptake dopamine therefore dopaminergic system brainstem mainly midbrain spinal cord unlikely participate onset syndrome relative gammaaminobutyric acidergic deficiency might occur diazepam gammaaminobutyric acidmimetic agent strikingly effective first reported patient neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused methylphenidate;neuroleptic malignant syndrome methylphenidate yearold female presented neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused methylphenidate defect supratentorial brain including basal ganglion striatum multicystic encephalomalacia due severe perinatal hypoxicischemic encephalopathy considered possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally accepted pathogenesis syndrome however methylphenidate dopamine agonist via inhibition uptake dopamine therefore dopaminergic system brainstem mainly midbrain spinal cord unlikely participate onset syndrome relative gammaaminobutyric acidergic deficiency might occur diazepam gammaaminobutyric acidmimetic agent strikingly effective first reported patient neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused methylphenidate;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Cloning of the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase gene, the key enzyme of alkaptonuria in mouse.;"We determined 48 amino acid residues from five peptides from the homogeneous monomer of homogentisate 1 , 2-dioxygenase ( HGO ; E . C . 1 . 13 . 11 . 15 ) of mouse liver . After digestion with trypsin , peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and amino acid sequenced . The deduced codon sequence of three peptides was used to derive degenerated oligomeres . By combining these oligos , we were able to amplify fragments from 100 to 300 bases ( b ) from mouse liver cDNA by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription ( RT-PCR ) . A fragment of 200 b was cloned and used as a probe to screen a mouse liver cDNA library . One clone from this library contained the complete cDNA-insert for HGO as determined by sequencing . The cDNA encodes for a protein of 50 kDa , as predicted . The cDNA of mouse HGO has an overall identity of 41 % to the corresponding gene hmgA from Aspergillus . Sequence similarities to human expressed sequence tags ( EST ) clones ranged from 70 % to 20 % . The positions of 122 conserved amino acids could be determined by multiple sequence alignment . We identified one first intron of 928 b in the mouse gene . The gene for HGO seems to be expressed in various tissues , as shown by RT-PCR on different cDNAs . FISH experiments with the whole murine cDNA as probe clearly revealed signals at the human chromosomal band 3q13 . 3-q21 . This corresponds well to the previous assignment of the locus for the human alkaptonuria gene ( AKU ) to the same chromosomal region by multipoint linkage analysis .

Alpha-lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy.;The study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection. We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.;neurological;alphalipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage neurotoxicity experimental chemotherapy neuropathy;study investigates alphalipoic acid neuroprotective chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity mitochondrial damage play critical role toxic neurodegenerative cascade neuroprotective effect alphalipoic acid depend mitochondrion protection used vitro model chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy closely mimic vivo condition exposing primary culture dorsal root ganglion drg sensory neuron paclitaxel cisplatin two widely used highly effective chemotherapeutic drug approach allowed investigating efficacy alphalipoic acid preventing axonal damage apoptosis function ultrastructural morphology mitochondrion exposure toxic agent alphalipoic acid result demonstrate cisplatin paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment loss membrane potential induction autophagic vacuole neuron alphalipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effect chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity sensory neuron rescue mitochondrial toxicity induces expression frataxin essential mitochondrial protein antioxidant chaperone property conclusion mitochondrial toxicity early common event paclitaxel cisplatin induced neurotoxicity alphalipoic acid protects sensory neuron antioxidant mitochondrial regulatory function possibly inducing expression frataxin finding suggest alphalipoic acid might reduce risk developing peripheral nerve toxicity patient undergoing chemotherapy encourage confirmatory clinical trial;alphalipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage neurotoxicity experimental chemotherapy neuropathy study investigates alphalipoic acid neuroprotective chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity mitochondrial damage play critical role toxic neurodegenerative cascade neuroprotective effect alphalipoic acid depend mitochondrion protection used vitro model chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy closely mimic vivo condition exposing primary culture dorsal root ganglion drg sensory neuron paclitaxel cisplatin two widely used highly effective chemotherapeutic drug approach allowed investigating efficacy alphalipoic acid preventing axonal damage apoptosis function ultrastructural morphology mitochondrion exposure toxic agent alphalipoic acid result demonstrate cisplatin paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment loss membrane potential induction autophagic vacuole neuron alphalipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effect chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity sensory neuron rescue mitochondrial toxicity induces expression frataxin essential mitochondrial protein antioxidant chaperone property conclusion mitochondrial toxicity early common event paclitaxel cisplatin induced neurotoxicity alphalipoic acid protects sensory neuron antioxidant mitochondrial regulatory function possibly inducing expression frataxin finding suggest alphalipoic acid might reduce risk developing peripheral nerve toxicity patient undergoing chemotherapy encourage confirmatory clinical trial;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations and one polymorphism: implications for structure-function analysis of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase.;We report here the molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations , L74P and F171S , and one polymorphism , S135L , in human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase ( GALT ) . Both galactosemia mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cDNA and overexpressed . The polymorphism , in contrast , has near normal activity . Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues , suggesting that they are functionally important , while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function . The F171S mutation is close to the putative active-site nucleophile . Our data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity of galactosemia and suggest that galactosemia mutations and GALT polymorphisms may be useful tools in highlighting different functional domains in human GALT . .;neurological;molecular characterization two galactosemia mutation one polymorphism implication structurefunction analysis human galactosephosphate uridyltransferase;report molecular characterization two galactosemia mutation one polymorphism human galactosephosphate uridyltransferase galt galactosemia mutation result reduced enzymatic activity reconstructed cdna overexpressed polymorphism contrast near normal activity mutation affect evolutionarily conserved residue suggesting functionally important polymorphism occurs nonconserved domain presumably critical enzymatic function mutation close putative activesite nucleophile data support notion molecular heterogeneity galactosemia suggest galactosemia mutation galt polymorphism may useful tool highlighting different functional domain human galt;molecular characterization two galactosemia mutation one polymorphism implication structurefunction analysis human galactosephosphate uridyltransferase report molecular characterization two galactosemia mutation one polymorphism human galactosephosphate uridyltransferase galt galactosemia mutation result reduced enzymatic activity reconstructed cdna overexpressed polymorphism contrast near normal activity mutation affect evolutionarily conserved residue suggesting functionally important polymorphism occurs nonconserved domain presumably critical enzymatic function mutation close putative activesite nucleophile data support notion molecular heterogeneity galactosemia suggest galactosemia mutation galt polymorphism may useful tool highlighting different functional domain human galt;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Cloning of human very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase and molecular characterization of its deficiency in two patients.;Two overlapping cDNA clones ( 1 , 991 bp and 736 bp , respectively ) encoding the precursor of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) were cloned and sequenced . The cDNA inserts of these clones together encompass a region of 2 , 177 bases , encoding the entire protein of 655 amino acids , including a 40-amino acid leader peptide and a 615-amino acid mature polypeptide . PCR-amplified VLCAD cDNAs were sequenced in cultured fibroblasts from two VLCAD-deficient patients . In both patients , a 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in VLCAD cDNA was identified . The deletion seems to occur due to exon skipping during processing of VLCAD pre-mRNA . This is the first demonstration of a mutation causing VLCAD deficiency . Quantitative cDNA expression of normal human VLCAD was performed in the patients fibroblasts , using vaccinia viral system , which demonstrated that the deficiency of the normal VLCAD protein causes impaired long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation activity in the patients fibroblasts . In patient fibroblasts , raising VLCAD activity to approximately 20 % of normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid beta-oxidation flux to the level found in control fibroblasts , which may offer important information for the rational design of future somatic gene therapy for VLCAD deficiency . .;neurological;cloning human verylongchain acylcoenzyme dehydrogenase molecular characterization deficiency two patient;two overlapping cdna clone respectively encoding precursor human mitochondrial verylongchain acylcoenzyme dehydrogenase vlcad cloned sequenced cdna insert clone together encompass region base encoding entire protein amino acid including amino acid leader peptide amino acid mature polypeptide pcramplified vlcad cdna sequenced cultured fibroblast two vlcaddeficient patient patient deletion encompassing base vlcad cdna identified deletion seems occur due exon skipping processing vlcad premrna first demonstration mutation causing vlcad deficiency quantitative cdna expression normal human vlcad performed patient fibroblast using vaccinia viral system demonstrated deficiency normal vlcad protein cause impaired longchain fatty acid betaoxidation activity patient fibroblast patient fibroblast raising vlcad activity approximately normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid betaoxidation flux level found control fibroblast may offer important information rational design future somatic gene therapy vlcad deficiency;cloning human verylongchain acylcoenzyme dehydrogenase molecular characterization deficiency two patient two overlapping cdna clone respectively encoding precursor human mitochondrial verylongchain acylcoenzyme dehydrogenase vlcad cloned sequenced cdna insert clone together encompass region base encoding entire protein amino acid including amino acid leader peptide amino acid mature polypeptide pcramplified vlcad cdna sequenced cultured fibroblast two vlcaddeficient patient patient deletion encompassing base vlcad cdna identified deletion seems occur due exon skipping processing vlcad premrna first demonstration mutation causing vlcad deficiency quantitative cdna expression normal human vlcad performed patient fibroblast using vaccinia viral system demonstrated deficiency normal vlcad protein cause impaired longchain fatty acid betaoxidation activity patient fibroblast patient fibroblast raising vlcad activity approximately normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid betaoxidation flux level found control fibroblast may offer important information rational design future somatic gene therapy vlcad deficiency;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Characteristics of intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in myotonic dystrophy.;In myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the size of a CTG repeat in the DM kinase gene generally increases in successive generations with clinical evidence of anticipation . However , there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat . We examined 1 , 489 DM parent-offspring pairs , of which 95 ( 6 . 4 % ) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes ( PBL ) . In 56 of the 95 pairs , clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status . It is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 ( 48 % ) of these 56 pairs , while none clearly showed a later onset of DM in the symptomatic offspring . The contraction occurred in 76 ( 10 % ) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 ( 3 % ) of 736 maternal transmissions . Anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal ( 85 % ) than in paternal ( 37 % ) transmissions ( P DM parents had multiple DM offspring with the CTG repeat contractions . This frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions ( 6 . 4 % ) and the size of DM sib population ( 1 . 54 DM offspring per DM parent , in 968 DM parents ) . We conclude that ( 1 ) intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in leukocyte DNA frequently accompanies apparent anticipation , especially when DM is maternally transmitted , and ( 2 ) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the CTG repeat contraction;neurological;characteristic intergenerational contraction ctg repeat myotonic dystrophy;myotonic dystrophy size ctg repeat kinase gene generally increase successive generation clinical evidence anticipation however also case intergenerational contraction repeat examined parentoffspring pair showed contraction peripheral blood leukocyte pbl pair clinical data allowed analysis anticipation status surprising anticipation occurred pair none clearly showed later onset symptomatic offspring contraction occurred paternal transmission maternal transmission anticipation observed frequently maternal paternal transmission parent multiple offspring ctg repeat contraction frequency higher frequency expected probability repeat contraction size sib population offspring per parent parent conclude intergenerational contraction ctg repeat leukocyte dna frequently accompanies apparent anticipation especially maternally transmitted paternal origin repeat presence repeat contraction sibling increase probability ctg repeat contraction;characteristic intergenerational contraction ctg repeat myotonic dystrophy myotonic dystrophy size ctg repeat kinase gene generally increase successive generation clinical evidence anticipation however also case intergenerational contraction repeat examined parentoffspring pair showed contraction peripheral blood leukocyte pbl pair clinical data allowed analysis anticipation status surprising anticipation occurred pair none clearly showed later onset symptomatic offspring contraction occurred paternal transmission maternal transmission anticipation observed frequently maternal paternal transmission parent multiple offspring ctg repeat contraction frequency higher frequency expected probability repeat contraction size sib population offspring per parent parent conclude intergenerational contraction ctg repeat leukocyte dna frequently accompanies apparent anticipation especially maternally transmitted paternal origin repeat presence repeat contraction sibling increase probability ctg repeat contraction;neurological;hepatorenal|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma.;In most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene . However , some of these patients can transmit retinoblastoma predisposition to their offspring . To determine the frequency and nature of constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , we analyzed DNA from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue . The analysis of tumors from 54 ( 71 % ) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity ( LOH ) at intragenic loci . Three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions . For 39 randomly selected tumors , SSCP , hetero-duplex analysis , sequencing , and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations . Mutations were detected in 21 ( 91 % ) of 23 tumors with LOH . In 6 ( 38 % ) of 16 tumors without LOH , one mutation was detected , and in 9 ( 56 % ) of the tumors without LOH , both mutations were found . Thus , a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients . Thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations , 2 large structural alterations , and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA . In 6 ( 17 % ) of the 36 patients , a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA , and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity . The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment . In 1 patient , somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood . In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood , mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma . In conclusion , our results emphasize that the manifestation and transmissibility of retinoblastoma depend on the nature of the first mutation , its time in development , and the number and types of cells that are affected . .;oncological;constitutional rbgene mutation patient isolated unilateral retinoblastoma;patient isolated unilateral retinoblastoma tumor development initiated somatic inactivation allele gene however patient transmit retinoblastoma predisposition offspring determine frequency nature constitutional rbgene mutation patient isolated unilateral retinoblastoma analyzed dna peripheral blood tumor tissue analysis tumor informative patient showed loss constitutional heterozygosity loh intragenic locus three uninformative patient constitutional deletion randomly selected tumor sscp heteroduplex analysis sequencing southern blot analysis used identify mutation mutation detected tumor loh tumor without loh one mutation detected tumor without loh mutation found thus total mutation identified tumor patient thirtynine mutationsincluding small mutation large structural alteration hypermethylation tumorswere detected corresponding peripheral blood dna patient mutation detected constitutional dna mutation known associated reduced expressivity presence constitutional mutation associated early age treatment patient somatic mosaicism demonstrated molecular analysis dna rna peripheral blood patient without detectable mutation peripheral blood mosaicism suggested patient showed multifocal tumor later developed bilateral retinoblastoma conclusion result emphasize manifestation transmissibility retinoblastoma depend nature first mutation time development number type cell affected;constitutional rbgene mutation patient isolated unilateral retinoblastoma patient isolated unilateral retinoblastoma tumor development initiated somatic inactivation allele gene however patient transmit retinoblastoma predisposition offspring determine frequency nature constitutional rbgene mutation patient isolated unilateral retinoblastoma analyzed dna peripheral blood tumor tissue analysis tumor informative patient showed loss constitutional heterozygosity loh intragenic locus three uninformative patient constitutional deletion randomly selected tumor sscp heteroduplex analysis sequencing southern blot analysis used identify mutation mutation detected tumor loh tumor without loh one mutation detected tumor without loh mutation found thus total mutation identified tumor patient thirtynine mutationsincluding small mutation large structural alteration hypermethylation tumorswere detected corresponding peripheral blood dna patient mutation detected constitutional dna mutation known associated reduced expressivity presence constitutional mutation associated early age treatment patient somatic mosaicism demonstrated molecular analysis dna rna peripheral blood patient without detectable mutation peripheral blood mosaicism suggested patient showed multifocal tumor later developed bilateral retinoblastoma conclusion result emphasize manifestation transmissibility retinoblastoma depend nature first mutation time development number type cell affected;oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Brca1 deficiency results in early embryonic lethality characterized by neuroepithelial abnormalities.;The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene , BRCA1 , has been cloned and shown to encode a zinc-finger protein of unknown function . Mutations in BRCA1 account for at least 80 % of families with both breast and ovarian cancer , as well as some non-familial sporadic ovarian cancers . The loss of wild-type BRCA1 in tumours of individuals carrying one nonfunctional BRCA1 allele suggests that BRCA1 encodes a tumour suppressor that may inhibit the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells . To examine the role of BRCA1 in normal tissue growth and differentiation , and to generate a potential model for the cancer susceptibility associated with loss of BRCA1 function , we have created a mouse line carrying a mutation in one Brca1 allele . Analysis of mice homozygous for the mutant allele indicate that Brca1 is critical for normal development , as these mice died in utero between 10 and 13 days of gestation ( E10-E13 ) . Abnormalities in Brca1-deficient embryos were most evident in the neural tube , with 40 % of the embryos presenting with varying degrees of spina bifida and anencephaly . In addition , the neuroepithelium in Brca1-deficient embryos appeared disorganized , with signs of both rapid proliferation and excessive cell death . .;neurological|oncological;brca deficiency result early embryonic lethality characterized neuroepithelial abnormality;breast ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca cloned shown encode zincfinger protein unknown function mutation brca account least family breast ovarian cancer well nonfamilial sporadic ovarian cancer loss wildtype brca tumour individual carrying one nonfunctional brca allele suggests brca encodes tumour suppressor may inhibit proliferation mammary epithelial cell examine role brca normal tissue growth differentiation generate potential model cancer susceptibility associated loss brca function created mouse line carrying mutation one brca allele analysis mouse homozygous mutant allele indicate brca critical normal development mouse died utero day gestation abnormality brcadeficient embryo evident neural tube embryo presenting varying degree spina bifida anencephaly addition neuroepithelium brcadeficient embryo appeared disorganized sign rapid proliferation excessive cell death;brca deficiency result early embryonic lethality characterized neuroepithelial abnormality breast ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca cloned shown encode zincfinger protein unknown function mutation brca account least family breast ovarian cancer well nonfamilial sporadic ovarian cancer loss wildtype brca tumour individual carrying one nonfunctional brca allele suggests brca encodes tumour suppressor may inhibit proliferation mammary epithelial cell examine role brca normal tissue growth differentiation generate potential model cancer susceptibility associated loss brca function created mouse line carrying mutation one brca allele analysis mouse homozygous mutant allele indicate brca critical normal development mouse died utero day gestation abnormality brcadeficient embryo evident neural tube embryo presenting varying degree spina bifida anencephaly addition neuroepithelium brcadeficient embryo appeared disorganized sign rapid proliferation excessive cell death;neurological|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Accelerated junctional rhythms during oral verapamil therapy.;This study examined the frequency of atrioventricular (AV) dissociation and accelerated junctional rhythms in 59 patients receiving oral verapamil. Accelerated junctional rhythms and AV dissociation were frequent in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly AV nodal reentry. Verapamil administration to these patients led to an asymptomatic increase in activity of these junctional pacemakers. In patients with various chest pain syndromes, verapamil neither increased the frequency of junctional rhythms nor suppressed their role as escape rhythms under physiologically appropriate circumstances.;neurological|cardiovascular;accelerated junctional rhythm oral verapamil therapy;study examined frequency atrioventricular dissociation accelerated junctional rhythm patient receiving oral verapamil accelerated junctional rhythm dissociation frequent patient supraventricular tachyarrhythmias particularly nodal reentry verapamil administration patient led asymptomatic increase activity junctional pacemaker patient various chest pain syndrome verapamil neither increased frequency junctional rhythm suppressed role escape rhythm physiologically appropriate circumstance;accelerated junctional rhythm oral verapamil therapy study examined frequency atrioventricular dissociation accelerated junctional rhythm patient receiving oral verapamil accelerated junctional rhythm dissociation frequent patient supraventricular tachyarrhythmias particularly nodal reentry verapamil administration patient led asymptomatic increase activity junctional pacemaker patient various chest pain syndrome verapamil neither increased frequency junctional rhythm suppressed role escape rhythm physiologically appropriate circumstance;neurological|cardiovascular;none;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation.;Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare. Therefore, when the arrhythmia is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved. Thyroid disorders, illicit drug or stimulant use, and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes. We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His medical history was unremarkable, except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied. However, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed. The patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control. When discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin, with follow-up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion. Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance. Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat, fish, and other animal products. Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia. Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements. In addition, it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature.;cardiovascular;lone atrial fibrillation associated creatine monohydrate supplementation;atrial fibrillation young patient without structural heart disease rare therefore arrhythmia present population reversible cause must identified resolved thyroid disorder illicit drug stimulant use acute alcohol intoxication among cause report case yearold caucasian man came emergency department atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular response medical history unremarkable except minor fracture finger foot thyroidstimulating hormone magnesium potassium level within normal limit urine drug screen negative alcohol use denied however patient questioned use herbal product supplement use creatine monohydrate revealed patient admitted hospital anticoagulated unfractionated heparin given intravenous diltiazem rate control intravenous amiodarone rate rhythm control discharged less hour later receiving metoprolol aspirin followup plan echocardiography nuclear imaging assess perfusion exogenous creatine used athlete theoretically improve exercise performance vegetarian may also take creatine replace consuming meat fish animal product previous anecdotal report linked creatine development arrhythmia clinician must diligent interviewing patient drug therapy history include question use herbal product dietary supplement addition important report adverse effect associated frequently consumed supplement herbal product food drug administration literature;lone atrial fibrillation associated creatine monohydrate supplementation atrial fibrillation young patient without structural heart disease rare therefore arrhythmia present population reversible cause must identified resolved thyroid disorder illicit drug stimulant use acute alcohol intoxication among cause report case yearold caucasian man came emergency department atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular response medical history unremarkable except minor fracture finger foot thyroidstimulating hormone magnesium potassium level within normal limit urine drug screen negative alcohol use denied however patient questioned use herbal product supplement use creatine monohydrate revealed patient admitted hospital anticoagulated unfractionated heparin given intravenous diltiazem rate control intravenous amiodarone rate rhythm control discharged less hour later receiving metoprolol aspirin followup plan echocardiography nuclear imaging assess perfusion exogenous creatine used athlete theoretically improve exercise performance vegetarian may also take creatine replace consuming meat fish animal product previous anecdotal report linked creatine development arrhythmia clinician must diligent interviewing patient drug therapy history include question use herbal product dietary supplement addition important report adverse effect associated frequently consumed supplement herbal product food drug administration literature;cardiovascular;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
The dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-associated collagen type Ialpha1/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain fusion gene generates a transforming protein that is processed to functional PDGF-BB.;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22 , which fuse the collagen type Ialpha1 ( COLIA1 ) gene to the platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) B-chain ( PDGFB ) gene . To characterize the functional and structural properties of the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion protein , we generated a stable NIH3T3 cell line that contained a tumor-derived chimeric gene resulting from a COIA1 intron 7-PDGFB intron 1 fusion . Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells . The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1 / PDGFB-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells . The presence of dimeric COLIA1 / PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies . Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1 / PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type PDGF-BB . Finally , COLIA1 / PDGFB-expressing cells generated tumors after s . c c . injection into nude mice , and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with CGP57148B . We conclude that the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF-BB and the formation of an autocrine loop . Our findings , thus , suggest that PDGF receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of DFSP and giant cell fibroblastoma , e . g . , through the use of PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors such as CGP57148B .;oncological;dermatofibrosarcoma protuberansassociated collagen type ialphaplateletderived growth factor pdgf bchain fusion gene generates transforming protein processed functional pdgfbb;dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans dfsp display chromosomal rearrangement involving chromosome fuse collagen type ialpha colia gene plateletderived growth factor pdgf bchain pdgfb gene characterize functional structural property colia pdgfb fusion protein generated stable niht cell line contained tumorderived chimeric gene resulting coia intron pdgfb intron fusion expression fusion protein led morphological transformation increased growth rate cell pdgf receptor kinase inhibitor cgpb reversed transformed phenotype reduced growth rate colia pdgfbexpressing cell effect control cell presence dimeric colia pdgfb precursor demonstrated pdgfb immunoprecipitations metabolically labeled cell also pdgfb immunoprecipitations followed immunoblotting colia antibody pulsechase study demonstrated colia pdgfb precursor processed end product indistinguishable wildtype pdgfbb finally colia pdgfbexpressing cell generated tumor injection nude mouse tumor growth reduced treatment cgpb conclude colia pdgfb fusion associated dfsp contributes tumor development ectopic production pdgfbb formation autocrine loop finding thus suggest pdgf receptor could target pharmacological treatment dfsp giant cell fibroblastoma use pdgf receptor kinase inhibitor cgpb;dermatofibrosarcoma protuberansassociated collagen type ialphaplateletderived growth factor pdgf bchain fusion gene generates transforming protein processed functional pdgfbb dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans dfsp display chromosomal rearrangement involving chromosome fuse collagen type ialpha colia gene plateletderived growth factor pdgf bchain pdgfb gene characterize functional structural property colia pdgfb fusion protein generated stable niht cell line contained tumorderived chimeric gene resulting coia intron pdgfb intron fusion expression fusion protein led morphological transformation increased growth rate cell pdgf receptor kinase inhibitor cgpb reversed transformed phenotype reduced growth rate colia pdgfbexpressing cell effect control cell presence dimeric colia pdgfb precursor demonstrated pdgfb immunoprecipitations metabolically labeled cell also pdgfb immunoprecipitations followed immunoblotting colia antibody pulsechase study demonstrated colia pdgfb precursor processed end product indistinguishable wildtype pdgfbb finally colia pdgfbexpressing cell generated tumor injection nude mouse tumor growth reduced treatment cgpb conclude colia pdgfb fusion associated dfsp contributes tumor development ectopic production pdgfbb formation autocrine loop finding thus suggest pdgf receptor could target pharmacological treatment dfsp giant cell fibroblastoma use pdgf receptor kinase inhibitor cgpb;oncological;hepatorenal|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Components of lemon essential oil attenuate dementia induced by scopolamine.;"The anti-dementia effects of s-limonene and s-perillyl alcohol were observed using the passive avoidance test (PA) and the open field habituation test (OFH). These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve memory impaired by scopolamine; however, s-perillyl alcohol relieved the deficit of associative memory in PA only, and did not improve non-associative memory significantly in OFH. Analysis of neurotransmitter concentration in some brain regions on the test day showed that dopamine concentration of the vehicle/scopolamine group was significantly lower than that of the vehicle/vehicle group, but this phenomenon was reversed when s-limonene or s-perillyl alcohol were administered before the injection of scopolamine. Simultaneously, we found that these two lemon essential oil components could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro using the Ellman method.";neurological;component lemon essential oil attenuate dementia induced scopolamine;antidementia effect slimonene sperillyl alcohol observed using passive avoidance test open field habituation test ofh lemon essential oil showed strong ability improve memory impaired scopolamine however sperillyl alcohol relieved deficit associative memory improve nonassociative memory significantly ofh analysis neurotransmitter concentration brain region test day showed dopamine concentration vehiclescopolamine group significantly lower vehiclevehicle group phenomenon reversed slimonene sperillyl alcohol administered injection scopolamine simultaneously found two lemon essential oil component could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity vitro using ellman method;component lemon essential oil attenuate dementia induced scopolamine antidementia effect slimonene sperillyl alcohol observed using passive avoidance test open field habituation test ofh lemon essential oil showed strong ability improve memory impaired scopolamine however sperillyl alcohol relieved deficit associative memory improve nonassociative memory significantly ofh analysis neurotransmitter concentration brain region test day showed dopamine concentration vehiclescopolamine group significantly lower vehiclevehicle group phenomenon reversed slimonene sperillyl alcohol administered injection scopolamine simultaneously found two lemon essential oil component could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity vitro using ellman method;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

A highly accurate, low cost test for BRCA1 mutations.;The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is associated with a high frequency of BRCA1 mutations . However , the widespread use of BRCA1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns  the fear of loss of health and life insurance , the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result , and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for BRCA1 mutations . We have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning , based on a combination of extensive multiplex PCR amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis . The efficiency of this system , as a screening test for BRCA1 mutations , was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women , 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in BRCA1 . All 14 mutations were identified , as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection . In addition to the 19 mutations , a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored , most of which were recurring . All were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing . The cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately US $ 70 for the manual technique used in this study , and may be reduced to approximately US $ 10 with the introduction of commercially available PCR robotics and fluorescent imaging . Implementation of this method of mutation screening in the research and clinical setting should permit rapid accrual of quantitative data on genotype-phenotype associations for the evaluation of diagnostic testing . .;oncological;highly accurate low cost test brca mutation;hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome associated high frequency brca mutation however widespread use brca testing limited date three principal concern fear loss health life insurance uncertain clinical value positive test result current lack inexpensive sensitive screening test brca mutation developed inexpensive system gene mutational scanning based combination extensive multiplex pcr amplification two dimensional electrophoresis efficiency system screening test brca mutation evaluated panel sample high risk woman contained previously identified mutation brca mutation identified well additional five previously escaped detection addition mutation total different polymorphic variant scored recurring confirmed nucleotide sequencing cost screening per sample calculated approximately manual technique used study may reduced approximately introduction commercially available pcr robotics fluorescent imaging implementation method mutation screening research clinical setting permit rapid accrual quantitative data genotypephenotype association evaluation diagnostic testing;highly accurate low cost test brca mutation hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome associated high frequency brca mutation however widespread use brca testing limited date three principal concern fear loss health life insurance uncertain clinical value positive test result current lack inexpensive sensitive screening test brca mutation developed inexpensive system gene mutational scanning based combination extensive multiplex pcr amplification two dimensional electrophoresis efficiency system screening test brca mutation evaluated panel sample high risk woman contained previously identified mutation brca mutation identified well additional five previously escaped detection addition mutation total different polymorphic variant scored recurring confirmed nucleotide sequencing cost screening per sample calculated approximately manual technique used study may reduced approximately introduction commercially available pcr robotics fluorescent imaging implementation method mutation screening research clinical setting permit rapid accrual quantitative data genotypephenotype association evaluation diagnostic testing;oncological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Duplicational mutation at the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus: its frequency, distribution, origin, and phenotypegenotype correlation.;Partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) and Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) . Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases . We have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients , analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA . With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity , 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene , a frequency of 14 % for nondeletion cases ( 10 / 72 ) , or 6 % for all cases ( 10 / 181 ) . The extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map , and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected . The resulting translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications . A shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases , while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases . RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family . In all five families , the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome . Unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications . .;neurological;duplicational mutation duchenne muscular dystrophy locus frequency distribution origin phenotypegenotype correlation;partial gene deletion major cause mutation leading duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd becker muscular dystrophy bmd partial gene duplication also recognized case conducted survey duplication unrelated nondeletion patient analyzed southern blot hybridization clone representing entire dmd cdna careful quantitative analysis hybridization band intensity case found carry duplication part gene frequency nondeletion case case extent duplication characterized according published exoncontaining hindiii fragment map six duplication novel restriction fragment spanned duplication junction detected resulting translational reading frame mrna predicted nine duplication shift reading frame predicted four six dmd case one two intermediate case reading frame remained uninterrupted bmd case rflp quantitative southern blot analysis revealed grandpaternal origin duplication four family grandmaternal origin one family five family duplication found originate single chromosome unequal sisterchromatid exchange proposed mechanism formation duplication;duplicational mutation duchenne muscular dystrophy locus frequency distribution origin phenotypegenotype correlation partial gene deletion major cause mutation leading duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd becker muscular dystrophy bmd partial gene duplication also recognized case conducted survey duplication unrelated nondeletion patient analyzed southern blot hybridization clone representing entire dmd cdna careful quantitative analysis hybridization band intensity case found carry duplication part gene frequency nondeletion case case extent duplication characterized according published exoncontaining hindiii fragment map six duplication novel restriction fragment spanned duplication junction detected resulting translational reading frame mrna predicted nine duplication shift reading frame predicted four six dmd case one two intermediate case reading frame remained uninterrupted bmd case rflp quantitative southern blot analysis revealed grandpaternal origin duplication four family grandmaternal origin one family five family duplication found originate single chromosome unequal sisterchromatid exchange proposed mechanism formation duplication;neurological;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination . The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization . ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator ( Grass Instrument Company , Quincy , MA ) . RESULTS . Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings , yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject . The subjects gene deletions were variable , ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions . The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice . CONCLUSIONS . The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity . The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons , including milder effects of the mouse gene defect , differences in muscle and retinal gene product , or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin . The ERG shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DMD and its milder allelic forms . .;neurological;effect dystrophin gene mutation erg mouse human;purpose author earlier finding negative electroretinogram erg boy duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd led investigate dystrophin gene deletion erg five boy dmd author wanted determined whether similar erg finding animal model dmd mdx mouse method ganzfeld erg recorded five boy dmd complete ophthalmic examination dystrophin gene analyzed southern blot hybridization erg recorded anesthetized mdx control mouse modified grass photostimulator grass instrument company quincy result ophthalmic examination five boy normal finding yet abnormal negative erg recorded subject subject gene deletion variable ranging large deletion detectable deletion erg mdx mouse normal differ significantly control mouse conclusion author believe unique erg recorded human subject manifestation dmd associated defect dystrophin gene locus represents new clinical entity erg mdx mouse may spared several reason including milder effect mouse gene defect difference muscle retinal gene product specie difference biochemical role dystrophin erg show promise becoming noninvasive diagnostic tool dmd milder allelic form;effect dystrophin gene mutation erg mouse human purpose author earlier finding negative electroretinogram erg boy duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd led investigate dystrophin gene deletion erg five boy dmd author wanted determined whether similar erg finding animal model dmd mdx mouse method ganzfeld erg recorded five boy dmd complete ophthalmic examination dystrophin gene analyzed southern blot hybridization erg recorded anesthetized mdx control mouse modified grass photostimulator grass instrument company quincy result ophthalmic examination five boy normal finding yet abnormal negative erg recorded subject subject gene deletion variable ranging large deletion detectable deletion erg mdx mouse normal differ significantly control mouse conclusion author believe unique erg recorded human subject manifestation dmd associated defect dystrophin gene locus represents new clinical entity erg mdx mouse may spared several reason including milder effect mouse gene defect difference muscle retinal gene product specie difference biochemical role dystrophin erg show promise becoming noninvasive diagnostic tool dmd milder allelic form;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin.;"PURPOSE: The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.";neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;dexrazoxane protects myelosuppression dna cleavageenhancing drug etoposide daunorubicin doxorubicin;purpose anthracyclines daunorubicin doxorubicin epipodophyllotoxin etoposide potent dna cleavageenhancing drug widely used clinical oncology however myelosuppression cardiac toxicity limit use dexrazoxane icrf recommended protection anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity experimental design widespread use hematologic toxicity following coadministration dexrazoxane three structurally different dna cleavage enhancer investigated sensitivity human murine blood progenitor cell etoposide daunorubicin doxorubicin dexrazoxane determined granulocytemacrophage colony forming assay likewise vivo bdf mouse treated etoposide daunorubicin doxorubicin without dexrazoxane wide range dos posttreatment full hematologic evaluation done result nontoxic dos dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression weight loss daunorubicin etoposide mouse antagonized antiproliferative effect colony assay however dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression weight loss vitro cytotoxicity doxorubicin conclusion although finding support observation dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity antitumor activity doxorubicin clinically potent antagonism daunorubicin activity raise concern possible interference anticancer efficacy certainly would call renewed attention data also suggest significant etoposide dose escalation perhaps possible use dexrazoxane clinical trial patient brain metastasis combining dexrazoxane high dos etoposide ongoing aim improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity successful represents exciting mechanism pharmacologic regulation side effect cytotoxic chemotherapy;dexrazoxane protects myelosuppression dna cleavageenhancing drug etoposide daunorubicin doxorubicin purpose anthracyclines daunorubicin doxorubicin epipodophyllotoxin etoposide potent dna cleavageenhancing drug widely used clinical oncology however myelosuppression cardiac toxicity limit use dexrazoxane icrf recommended protection anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity experimental design widespread use hematologic toxicity following coadministration dexrazoxane three structurally different dna cleavage enhancer investigated sensitivity human murine blood progenitor cell etoposide daunorubicin doxorubicin dexrazoxane determined granulocytemacrophage colony forming assay likewise vivo bdf mouse treated etoposide daunorubicin doxorubicin without dexrazoxane wide range dos posttreatment full hematologic evaluation done result nontoxic dos dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression weight loss daunorubicin etoposide mouse antagonized antiproliferative effect colony assay however dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression weight loss vitro cytotoxicity doxorubicin conclusion although finding support observation dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity antitumor activity doxorubicin clinically potent antagonism daunorubicin activity raise concern possible interference anticancer efficacy certainly would call renewed attention data also suggest significant etoposide dose escalation perhaps possible use dexrazoxane clinical trial patient brain metastasis combining dexrazoxane high dos etoposide ongoing aim improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity successful represents exciting mechanism pharmacologic regulation side effect cytotoxic chemotherapy;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine monotherapy.;Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, remains a major health problem in Asian countries. Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers, although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now. In this report, we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman. Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient, thus this patient had been referred to our hospital. However, the administration of lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity. During this period, no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged, and the serum HBV-DNA level was continuously suppressed. These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued. Moreover, both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient. The administration of lamivudine to patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, like our present case, should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option, especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available.;hepatorenal|oncological;sustained clinical improvement patient decompensated hepatitis virusrelated cirrhosis treatment lamivudine monotherapy;hepatitis virus hbv infection cause liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma remains major health problem asian country recent development vaccine prevention reported successful reducing size chronically infected carrier although standard medical therapy established report encountered patient decompensated hbvrelated cirrhosis exhibited dramatic improvement antiviral therapy patient yearold woman previous conventional medical treatment effective patient thus patient referred hospital however administration lamivudine reverse transcriptase inhibitor month dramatically improved liver severity period drug resistant mutant hbv emerged serum hbvdna level continuously suppressed virological response also maintained even antiviral therapy discontinued moreover hepatitis surface antigen antigen observed disappeared patient administration lamivudine patient hbvrelated cirrhosis like present case considered initial medical therapeutic option especially country liver transplantation reliably available;sustained clinical improvement patient decompensated hepatitis virusrelated cirrhosis treatment lamivudine monotherapy hepatitis virus hbv infection cause liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma remains major health problem asian country recent development vaccine prevention reported successful reducing size chronically infected carrier although standard medical therapy established report encountered patient decompensated hbvrelated cirrhosis exhibited dramatic improvement antiviral therapy patient yearold woman previous conventional medical treatment effective patient thus patient referred hospital however administration lamivudine reverse transcriptase inhibitor month dramatically improved liver severity period drug resistant mutant hbv emerged serum hbvdna level continuously suppressed virological response also maintained even antiviral therapy discontinued moreover hepatitis surface antigen antigen observed disappeared patient administration lamivudine patient hbvrelated cirrhosis like present case considered initial medical therapeutic option especially country liver transplantation reliably available;hepatorenal|oncological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Progesterone potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cultures.;The effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined. After determining the bupivacaine AD50 (the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50% of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic), we determined the effect of 1-hour progesterone HCl exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm. Each concentration of progesterone (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 micrograms/ml) caused a significant and concentration-dependent reduction in the AD50 for bupivacaine. Estradiol treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures, but was only one fourth as potent as progesterone. Neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by epinephrine. Chronic progesterone pretreatment (5 mg/kg/day for 21 days) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in intact pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control nonprogesterone-treated rats (6.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.5 min, mean +/- SE). The results of this study indicate that progesterone can potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro. Potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmia in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level.;neurological|cardiovascular;progesterone potentiation bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity pentobarbitalanesthetized rat beating rat heart cell culture;effect progesterone treatment bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity beating rat heart myocyte culture anesthetized rat determined determining bupivacaine concentration bupivacaine caused beating rat heart myocyte culture become arrhythmic determined effect hour progesterone hcl exposure myocyte contractile rhythm concentration progesterone microgramsml caused significant concentrationdependent reduction bupivacaine estradiol treatment also increased arrhythmogenicity bupivacaine myocyte culture one fourth potent progesterone neither progesterone estradiol effect bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity potentiated epinephrine chronic progesterone pretreatment mgkgday day caused significant increase bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity intact pentobarbitalanesthetized rat significant decrease time onset arrhythmia compared control nonprogesteronetreated rat min mean result study indicate progesterone potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity vivo vitro potentiation bupivacaine arrhythmia myocyte culture suggests effect least partly mediated myocyte level;progesterone potentiation bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity pentobarbitalanesthetized rat beating rat heart cell culture effect progesterone treatment bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity beating rat heart myocyte culture anesthetized rat determined determining bupivacaine concentration bupivacaine caused beating rat heart myocyte culture become arrhythmic determined effect hour progesterone hcl exposure myocyte contractile rhythm concentration progesterone microgramsml caused significant concentrationdependent reduction bupivacaine estradiol treatment also increased arrhythmogenicity bupivacaine myocyte culture one fourth potent progesterone neither progesterone estradiol effect bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity potentiated epinephrine chronic progesterone pretreatment mgkgday day caused significant increase bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity intact pentobarbitalanesthetized rat significant decrease time onset arrhythmia compared control nonprogesteronetreated rat min mean result study indicate progesterone potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity vivo vitro potentiation bupivacaine arrhythmia myocyte culture suggests effect least partly mediated myocyte level;neurological|cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Regional localization of the antagonism of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity by intracerebral calcitonin injections.;Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain, and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects. Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens. In the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake. The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.;neurological;regional localization antagonism amphetamineinduced hyperactivity intracerebral calcitonin injection;calcitonin receptor found brain intracerebral infusion calcitonin produce behavioral effect among behavioral effect decrease food intake decrease amphetamineinduced locomotor activity previous experiment found decrease food intake induced local administration calcitonin several hypothalamic site nucleus accumbens present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity locally injected site decrease food intake area calcitonin effective decreasing locomotor activity located hypothalamus nucleus accumbens suggesting area major site action calcitonin inhibiting amphetamineinduced locomotor activity;regional localization antagonism amphetamineinduced hyperactivity intracerebral calcitonin injection calcitonin receptor found brain intracerebral infusion calcitonin produce behavioral effect among behavioral effect decrease food intake decrease amphetamineinduced locomotor activity previous experiment found decrease food intake induced local administration calcitonin several hypothalamic site nucleus accumbens present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity locally injected site decrease food intake area calcitonin effective decreasing locomotor activity located hypothalamus nucleus accumbens suggesting area major site action calcitonin inhibiting amphetamineinduced locomotor activity;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase from MC-IXC cells and improves drug-induced amnesia.;The choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ACh), is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia.;neurological;daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase mcixc cell improves druginduced amnesia;choline acetyltransferase chat activator enhances cholinergic transmission via augmentation enzymatic production acetylcholine ach important factor treatment alzheimers disease methanolic extract pueraria thunbergiana exhibited activation effect chat vitro via sequential isolation pueraria thunbergiana active component ultimately identified daidzein dihydroxyisoflavone order investigate effect daidzein pueraria thunbergiana scopolamineinduced impairment learning memory conducted series vivo test administration daidzein mgkg body weight mouse shown significantly reverse scopolamineinduced amnesia according result ymaze test injection scopolamine mouse resulted impaired performance ymaze test decrease alternation behavior way contrast mouse treated daidzein prior scopolamine injection noticeably protected performance impairment approximately decrease alternation behavior result indicate daidzein might play role acetylcholine biosynthesis chat activator also ameliorates scopolamineinduced amnesia;daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase mcixc cell improves druginduced amnesia choline acetyltransferase chat activator enhances cholinergic transmission via augmentation enzymatic production acetylcholine ach important factor treatment alzheimers disease methanolic extract pueraria thunbergiana exhibited activation effect chat vitro via sequential isolation pueraria thunbergiana active component ultimately identified daidzein dihydroxyisoflavone order investigate effect daidzein pueraria thunbergiana scopolamineinduced impairment learning memory conducted series vivo test administration daidzein mgkg body weight mouse shown significantly reverse scopolamineinduced amnesia according result ymaze test injection scopolamine mouse resulted impaired performance ymaze test decrease alternation behavior way contrast mouse treated daidzein prior scopolamine injection noticeably protected performance impairment approximately decrease alternation behavior result indicate daidzein might play role acetylcholine biosynthesis chat activator also ameliorates scopolamineinduced amnesia;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in a patient with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP).;Molecular study of a new variant (G6PD Clinic) with markedly acidic pH optimum. A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) variant with severe erythrocytic G6PD deficiency and a unique pH optimum is described in a young patient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia ( CNSHA ) and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP ) . Chronic hemolysis was present in the absence of infections , oxidant drugs or ingestion of faba beans . Residual enzyme activity was about 2 . 6 % and 63 % of normal activity in erythrocytes and leucocytes , respectively . A molecular study using standard methods showed G6PD in the patient to have normal electrophoretic mobility ( at pH 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 and 8 . 8 ) , normal apparent affinity for substrates ( Km , G6P and NADP ) and a slightly abnormal utilization of substrate analogues ( decreased deamino-NADP and increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization ) . Heat stability was found to be markedly decreased ( 8 % of residual activity after 20 min of incubation at 46 degrees C ) and a particular characteristic of this enzyme was a biphasic pH curve with a greatly increased activity at low pH . Although molecular characteristics of this variant closely resemble those of G6PD Bangkok and G6PD Duarte , it can be distinguished from these and all other previously reported variants by virtue of its unusual pH curve . Therefore the present variant has been designated G6PD Clinic to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described;neurological;chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia cnsha glucose phosphate dehydrogenase gpd deficiency patient familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy fap;molecular study new variant gpd clinic markedly acidic optimum new glucosephosphate dehydrogenase gpd variant severe erythrocytic gpd deficiency unique optimum described young patient chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia cnsha familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy fap chronic hemolysis present absence infection oxidant drug ingestion faba bean residual enzyme activity normal activity erythrocyte leucocyte respectively molecular study using standard method showed gpd patient normal electrophoretic mobility normal apparent affinity substrate nadp slightly abnormal utilization substrate analogue decreased deaminonadp increased deoxyglucosephosphate utilization heat stability found markedly decreased residual activity min incubation degree particular characteristic enzyme biphasic curve greatly increased activity low although molecular characteristic variant closely resemble gpd bangkok gpd duarte distinguished previously reported variant virtue unusual curve therefore present variant designated gpd clinic distinguish gpd variant previously described;chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia cnsha glucose phosphate dehydrogenase gpd deficiency patient familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy fap molecular study new variant gpd clinic markedly acidic optimum new glucosephosphate dehydrogenase gpd variant severe erythrocytic gpd deficiency unique optimum described young patient chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia cnsha familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy fap chronic hemolysis present absence infection oxidant drug ingestion faba bean residual enzyme activity normal activity erythrocyte leucocyte respectively molecular study using standard method showed gpd patient normal electrophoretic mobility normal apparent affinity substrate nadp slightly abnormal utilization substrate analogue decreased deaminonadp increased deoxyglucosephosphate utilization heat stability found markedly decreased residual activity min incubation degree particular characteristic enzyme biphasic curve greatly increased activity low although molecular characteristic variant closely resemble gpd bangkok gpd duarte distinguished previously reported variant virtue unusual curve therefore present variant designated gpd clinic distinguish gpd variant previously described;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus.;Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life. Although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages. Viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;definition management anemia patient infected hepatitis virus;chronic infection hepatitis virus hcv progress cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma endstage liver disease current best treatment hcv infection combination therapy pegylated interferon ribavirin although regimen produce sustained virologic response svr approximately patient associated potentially doselimiting hemolytic anemia hemoglobin concentration decrease mainly result ribavirininduced hemolysis anemia problematic patient hcv infection especially comorbid renal cardiovascular disorder general anemia increase risk morbidity mortality may negative effect cerebral function quality life although ribavirinassociated anemia reversed dose reduction discontinuation approach compromise outcome significantly decreasing svr rate recombinant human erythropoietin used manage ribavirinassociated anemia potential disadvantage viramidine livertargeting prodrug ribavirin potential maintain virologic efficacy ribavirin decreasing risk hemolytic anemia patient chronic hepatitis;definition management anemia patient infected hepatitis virus chronic infection hepatitis virus hcv progress cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma endstage liver disease current best treatment hcv infection combination therapy pegylated interferon ribavirin although regimen produce sustained virologic response svr approximately patient associated potentially doselimiting hemolytic anemia hemoglobin concentration decrease mainly result ribavirininduced hemolysis anemia problematic patient hcv infection especially comorbid renal cardiovascular disorder general anemia increase risk morbidity mortality may negative effect cerebral function quality life although ribavirinassociated anemia reversed dose reduction discontinuation approach compromise outcome significantly decreasing svr rate recombinant human erythropoietin used manage ribavirinassociated anemia potential disadvantage viramidine livertargeting prodrug ribavirin potential maintain virologic efficacy ribavirin decreasing risk hemolytic anemia patient chronic hepatitis;cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Antirifampicin antibodies in acute rifampicin-associated renal failure.;5 patients with acute renal failure (3 with thrombopenia and hemolysis) induced by the reintroduction of rifampicin are described. No correlation was found between the severity of clinical manifestations and the total dose taken by the patients. In all but 1 patient, antirifampicin antibodies were detected. Antibodies suggested to be of the IgM class were detected in all 3 patients with hematological disorders. The pattern of non-specific acute tubular necrosis found in the 2 biopsied patients, indistinguishable from that of ischemic origin, raised the possibility of a vascular-mediated damage.

Abnormal development of Purkinje cells and lymphocytes in Atm mutant mice.;Motor incoordination , immune deficiencies , and an increased risk of cancer are the characteristic features of the hereditary disease ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) , which is caused by mutations in the ATM gene . Through gene targeting , we have generated a line of Atm mutant mice , Atm ( y / y ) mice . In contrast to other Atm mutant mice , Atm ( y / y ) mice show a lower incidence of thymic lymphoma and survive beyond a few months of age . Atm ( y / y ) mice exhibit deficits in motor learning indicative of cerebellar dysfunction . Even though we found no gross cerebellar degeneration in older Atm ( y / y ) animals , ectopic and abnormally differentiated Purkinje cells were apparent in mutant mice of all ages . These findings establish that some neuropathological abnormalities seen in A-T patients also are present in Atm mutant mice . In addition , we report a previously unrecognized effect of Atm deficiency on development or maintenance of CD4 ( + ) 8 ( + ) thymocytes .

5 flourouracil-induced apical ballooning syndrome: a case report.;The apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) is a recently described stress-mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular (LV) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease. Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. A 79-year-old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram. She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions. The patient was stabilized with medical therapy. Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic. Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis. Pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm, endothelial damage and consequent thrombus formation. In our patient, both supraphysiologic levels of plasma catecholamines and stress related neuropeptides caused by cancer diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of ABS.;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;flourouracilinduced apical ballooning syndrome case report;apical ballooning syndrome ab recently described stressmediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized transient wallmotion abnormality involving apex midventricle hyperkinesis basal left ventricular segment without obstructive epicardial coronary disease cardiotoxicity uncommon adverse effect chemotherapeutic agent however report ab secondary chemotherapeutic agent describe case woman developed syndrome chemotherapy metastatic cancer yearold woman presented typical ischemic chest pain elevated cardiac enzyme significant stsegment abnormality electrocardiogram underwent recent chemotherapy fluorouracil metastatic colorectal cancer echocardiography revealed wallmotion abnormality involving apical periapical segment appeared akinetic coronary angiography revealed obstructive coronary lesion patient stabilized medical therapy four week later remained completely asymptomatic echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction resolution apical akinesis pathogenetic mechanism cardiac complication cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm endothelial damage consequent thrombus formation patient supraphysiologic level plasma catecholamine stress related neuropeptides caused cancer diagnosis well chemotherapy may contributed development ab;flourouracilinduced apical ballooning syndrome case report apical ballooning syndrome ab recently described stressmediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized transient wallmotion abnormality involving apex midventricle hyperkinesis basal left ventricular segment without obstructive epicardial coronary disease cardiotoxicity uncommon adverse effect chemotherapeutic agent however report ab secondary chemotherapeutic agent describe case woman developed syndrome chemotherapy metastatic cancer yearold woman presented typical ischemic chest pain elevated cardiac enzyme significant stsegment abnormality electrocardiogram underwent recent chemotherapy fluorouracil metastatic colorectal cancer echocardiography revealed wallmotion abnormality involving apical periapical segment appeared akinetic coronary angiography revealed obstructive coronary lesion patient stabilized medical therapy four week later remained completely asymptomatic echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction resolution apical akinesis pathogenetic mechanism cardiac complication cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm endothelial damage consequent thrombus formation patient supraphysiologic level plasma catecholamine stress related neuropeptides caused cancer diagnosis well chemotherapy may contributed development ab;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Inactivation of germline mutant APC alleles by attenuated somatic mutations: a molecular genetic mechanism for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis.;Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumor-suppressor gene result in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . Patients with FAP typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer . A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP ( AFAP ) phenotype , in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age . Although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented , the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined . We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele ( APC ( AS9 ) ) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9 . APC ( AS9 ) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription , the major tumor-suppressor function of APC , as did the wild-type APC . Mutation analysis showed that both APC ( AS9 ) and the wild-type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients . Functional analysis showed that 4666insA , a common somatic mutation in APC ( AS9 ) in these tumors , did not inactivate the wild-type APC . Our results indicate that carriers of APC ( AS9 ) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis . However , these patients develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general population because APC ( AS9 ) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild-type APC . .;oncological;inactivation germline mutant apc allele attenuated somatic mutation molecular genetic mechanism attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis;germline mutation adenomatous polyposis coli apc tumorsuppressor gene result familial adenomatous polyposis fap patient fap typically develop hundred thousand benign colorectal tumor earlyonset colorectal cancer subset germline apc mutation result attenuated fap afap phenotype patient develop fewer tumor develop older age although genotypephenotype correlation location apc germline mutation development afap well documented mechanism afap well defined investigated mechanism afap patient carrying mutant apc allele apc mutation alternatively spliced region exon apc found downregulate betacateninregulated transcription major tumorsuppressor function apc wildtype apc mutation analysis showed apc wildtype apc allele somatically mutated colorectal tumor patient functional analysis showed insa common somatic mutation apc tumor inactivate wildtype apc result indicate carrier apc develop fewer colorectal tumor typical patient fap somatic inactivation apc allele necessary colorectal tumorigenesis however patient develop colorectal tumor frequently general population apc inactivated mutation inactivate wildtype apc;inactivation germline mutant apc allele attenuated somatic mutation molecular genetic mechanism attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis germline mutation adenomatous polyposis coli apc tumorsuppressor gene result familial adenomatous polyposis fap patient fap typically develop hundred thousand benign colorectal tumor earlyonset colorectal cancer subset germline apc mutation result attenuated fap afap phenotype patient develop fewer tumor develop older age although genotypephenotype correlation location apc germline mutation development afap well documented mechanism afap well defined investigated mechanism afap patient carrying mutant apc allele apc mutation alternatively spliced region exon apc found downregulate betacateninregulated transcription major tumorsuppressor function apc wildtype apc mutation analysis showed apc wildtype apc allele somatically mutated colorectal tumor patient functional analysis showed insa common somatic mutation apc tumor inactivate wildtype apc result indicate carrier apc develop fewer colorectal tumor typical patient fap somatic inactivation apc allele necessary colorectal tumorigenesis however patient develop colorectal tumor frequently general population apc inactivated mutation inactivate wildtype apc;oncological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to concomitant use of simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir.;"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L creatine kinase, 93 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dL creatinine, 1579 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.";cardiovascular|hepatorenal;severe rhabdomyolysis acute renal failure secondary concomitant use simvastatin amiodarone atazanavir;objective report case severe interaction simvastatin amiodarone atazanavir resulting rhabdomyolysis acute renal failure background yearold white man underlying human immunodeficiency virus atrial fibrillation coronary artery disease hyperlipidemia presented generalized pain fatigue dark orange urine day patient taking simvastatin bedtime initiated day earlier amiodarone dose daily day daily initiated day earlier atazanavir daily initiated least year previously laboratory evaluation revealed creatine kinase mgdl blood urea nitrogen mgdl creatinine aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase simvastatin amiodarone patient human immunodeficiency virus medication temporarily discontinued patient given forced alkaline diuresis started dialysis nine day later patient creatine kinase dropped creatinine mgdl patient discharged continued outpatient dialysis month renal function recovered discussion risk rhabdomyolysis increased presence concomitant drug inhibit simvastatin metabolism simvastatin metabolized cypa amiodarone atazanavir recognized cypa inhibitor conclusion pharmacokinetic difference statin important consideration assessing risk potential drug interaction patient requiring concurrent use statin cypa inhibitor pravastatin fluvastatin rosuvastatin carry lowest risk drug interaction atorvastatin carry moderate risk whereas simvastatin lovastatin highest risk avoided patient taking concomitant cypa inhibitor;severe rhabdomyolysis acute renal failure secondary concomitant use simvastatin amiodarone atazanavir objective report case severe interaction simvastatin amiodarone atazanavir resulting rhabdomyolysis acute renal failure background yearold white man underlying human immunodeficiency virus atrial fibrillation coronary artery disease hyperlipidemia presented generalized pain fatigue dark orange urine day patient taking simvastatin bedtime initiated day earlier amiodarone dose daily day daily initiated day earlier atazanavir daily initiated least year previously laboratory evaluation revealed creatine kinase mgdl blood urea nitrogen mgdl creatinine aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase simvastatin amiodarone patient human immunodeficiency virus medication temporarily discontinued patient given forced alkaline diuresis started dialysis nine day later patient creatine kinase dropped creatinine mgdl patient discharged continued outpatient dialysis month renal function recovered discussion risk rhabdomyolysis increased presence concomitant drug inhibit simvastatin metabolism simvastatin metabolized cypa amiodarone atazanavir recognized cypa inhibitor conclusion pharmacokinetic difference statin important consideration assessing risk potential drug interaction patient requiring concurrent use statin cypa inhibitor pravastatin fluvastatin rosuvastatin carry lowest risk drug interaction atorvastatin carry moderate risk whereas simvastatin lovastatin highest risk avoided patient taking concomitant cypa inhibitor;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

The Pendred syndrome gene encodes a chloride-iodide transport protein.;"Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness and characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goitre . This disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing Pendred syndrome ( PDS ) was subsequently identified by positional cloning . PDS encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin . Pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate-anion transporter ( encoded by Sat-1 ; 29 % amino acid sequence identity ) , the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter ( encoded by DTD ; 32 % ) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma ( encoded by DRA ; 45 % ) . On the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate-transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain , pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter . We were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of PDS cRNA or in Sf9 cells following infection with PDS-recombinant baculovirus . The rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems . Our results demonstrate that pendrin functions as a transporter of chloride and iodide , but not sulfate , and may provide insight into thyroid physiology and the pathophysiology of Pendred syndrome . .";neurological;pendred syndrome gene encodes chlorideiodide transport protein;pendred syndrome common form syndromic deafness characterized congenital sensorineural hearing loss goitre disorder mapped chromosome gene causing pendred syndrome pd subsequently identified positional cloning pd encodes putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin pendrin closely related family sulfate transport protein includes rat sulfateanion transporter encoded sat amino acid sequence identity human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter encoded dtd human sulfate transporter downregulated adenoma encoded dra basis homology presence slightly modified sulfatetransporter signature sequence comprising putative second transmembrane domain pendrin proposed function sulfate transporter unable detect evidence sulfate transport following expression pendrin xenopus laevis oocyte microinjection pd crna cell following infection pdsrecombinant baculovirus rate transport iodide chloride significantly increased following expression pendrin cell system result demonstrate pendrin function transporter chloride iodide sulfate may provide insight thyroid physiology pathophysiology pendred syndrome;pendred syndrome gene encodes chlorideiodide transport protein pendred syndrome common form syndromic deafness characterized congenital sensorineural hearing loss goitre disorder mapped chromosome gene causing pendred syndrome pd subsequently identified positional cloning pd encodes putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin pendrin closely related family sulfate transport protein includes rat sulfateanion transporter encoded sat amino acid sequence identity human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter encoded dtd human sulfate transporter downregulated adenoma encoded dra basis homology presence slightly modified sulfatetransporter signature sequence comprising putative second transmembrane domain pendrin proposed function sulfate transporter unable detect evidence sulfate transport following expression pendrin xenopus laevis oocyte microinjection pd crna cell following infection pdsrecombinant baculovirus rate transport iodide chloride significantly increased following expression pendrin cell system result demonstrate pendrin function transporter chloride iodide sulfate may provide insight thyroid physiology pathophysiology pendred syndrome;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Peripheral neuropathy caused by high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.;"The central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. A 49-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy. The first course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot. Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves. This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone. Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.";neurological|oncological;peripheral neuropathy caused highdose cytosine arabinoside treatment patient acute myeloid leukemia;central nervous system toxicity highdose cytosine arabinoside well recognized toxicity cytosine arabinoside peripheral nervous system infrequently reported yearold japanese man diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia achieved complete remission received highdose cytosine arabinoside treatment twice day day total consolidation therapy first course highdose cytosine arabinoside resulted unusual symptom day second course treatment patient complained numbness right foot electromyogram nerveconduction study showed peripheral neuropathy peroneal nerve neuropathy gradually resolving however patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation symptom worsened development graftversushost disease symptom subsequently responded methylprednisolone although mechanism peripheral neuropathy still unclear highdose cytosine arabinoside therapy potentially toxic peripheral nervous system autoalloimmunity may play important role mechanism;peripheral neuropathy caused highdose cytosine arabinoside treatment patient acute myeloid leukemia central nervous system toxicity highdose cytosine arabinoside well recognized toxicity cytosine arabinoside peripheral nervous system infrequently reported yearold japanese man diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia achieved complete remission received highdose cytosine arabinoside treatment twice day day total consolidation therapy first course highdose cytosine arabinoside resulted unusual symptom day second course treatment patient complained numbness right foot electromyogram nerveconduction study showed peripheral neuropathy peroneal nerve neuropathy gradually resolving however patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation symptom worsened development graftversushost disease symptom subsequently responded methylprednisolone although mechanism peripheral neuropathy still unclear highdose cytosine arabinoside therapy potentially toxic peripheral nervous system autoalloimmunity may play important role mechanism;neurological|oncological;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin-induced renal damage.;"BACKGROUND: In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain. This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage.";hepatorenal;individual difference renal ace activity healthy rat predict susceptibility adriamycininduced renal damage;background man difference angiotensinconverting enzyme ace level related ace genotype associated renal prognosis raise hypothesis individual difference renal ace activity involved renal susceptibility inflicted damage therefore studied predictive effect renal ace activity severity renal damage induced single injection adriamycin rat method renal ace activity hiphisleu cleavage cortical homogenate determined renal biopsy adult male wistar rat week recovery proteinuria induced adriamycin mgkg intravenously control saline proteinuria measured every week week rat sacrificed kidney harvested result anticipated adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria renal interstitial damage mild focal glomerulosclerosis baseline renal ace positively correlated relative rise proteinuria adriamycin renal interstitial alphasmooth muscle actin interstitial macrophage influx interstitial collagen iii glomerular alphasmooth muscle actin glomerular desmin baseline renal ace correlate focal glomerulosclerosis control predictive value renal parameter observed conclusion individual difference renal ace activity predict severity adriamycininduced renal damage outbred rat strain support assumption difference renal ace activity predispose less favourable course renal damage;individual difference renal ace activity healthy rat predict susceptibility adriamycininduced renal damage background man difference angiotensinconverting enzyme ace level related ace genotype associated renal prognosis raise hypothesis individual difference renal ace activity involved renal susceptibility inflicted damage therefore studied predictive effect renal ace activity severity renal damage induced single injection adriamycin rat method renal ace activity hiphisleu cleavage cortical homogenate determined renal biopsy adult male wistar rat week recovery proteinuria induced adriamycin mgkg intravenously control saline proteinuria measured every week week rat sacrificed kidney harvested result anticipated adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria renal interstitial damage mild focal glomerulosclerosis baseline renal ace positively correlated relative rise proteinuria adriamycin renal interstitial alphasmooth muscle actin interstitial macrophage influx interstitial collagen iii glomerular alphasmooth muscle actin glomerular desmin baseline renal ace correlate focal glomerulosclerosis control predictive value renal parameter observed conclusion individual difference renal ace activity predict severity adriamycininduced renal damage outbred rat strain support assumption difference renal ace activity predispose less favourable course renal damage;hepatorenal;cardiovascular|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Sub-chronic inhibition of nitric-oxide synthesis modifies haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NADPH-diaphorase neurons in mice.;RATIONALE: NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), induces catalepsy in mice. This effect undergoes rapid tolerance, showing a significant decrease after 2 days of sub-chronic L-NOARG treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum. Neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol, which block dopamine receptors, also cause catalepsy in rodents. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of subchronic L-NOARG treatment in haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NOS neurons in areas related to motor control. METHODS: Male albino Swiss mice were treated sub-chronically (twice a day for 4 days) with L-NOARG (40 mg/kg i.p.) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Catalepsy was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatments. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry was also employed to visualize NOS as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control. RESULTS: L-NOARG sub-chronic administration produced tolerance of L-NOARG and of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It also induced an increase in the number of NADPH-d-positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with haloperidol and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline. In contrast, there was a decrease in NADPH-d neuron number in the substantia nigra, pars compacta in both haloperidol-treated and L-NOARG-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results give further support to the hypothesis that NO plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment.;neurological;subchronic inhibition nitricoxide synthesis modifies haloperidolinduced catalepsy number nadphdiaphorase neuron mouse;rationale ngnitrolarginine lnoarg inhibitor nitricoxide synthase no induces catalepsy mouse effect undergoes rapid tolerance showing significant decrease day subchronic lnoarg treatment nitric oxide shown influence dopaminergic neurotransmission striatum neuroleptic drug haloperidol block dopamine receptor also cause catalepsy rodent objective investigate effect subchronic lnoarg treatment haloperidolinduced catalepsy number no neuron area related motor control method male albino swiss mouse treated subchronically twice day day lnoarg mgkg haloperidol mgkg catalepsy evaluated beginning end treatment reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatediaphorase nadphd histochemistry also employed visualize no index enzyme expression mouse brain region related motor control result lnoarg subchronic administration produced tolerance lnoarg haloperidolinduced catalepsy also induced increase number nadphdpositive cell dorsal part caudate accumbens nucleus compared haloperidol pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared saline contrast decrease nadphd neuron number substantia nigra par compacta haloperidoltreated lnoargtreated animal conclusion result give support hypothesis play role motor behavior control suggest may take part synaptic change produced antipsychotic treatment;subchronic inhibition nitricoxide synthesis modifies haloperidolinduced catalepsy number nadphdiaphorase neuron mouse rationale ngnitrolarginine lnoarg inhibitor nitricoxide synthase no induces catalepsy mouse effect undergoes rapid tolerance showing significant decrease day subchronic lnoarg treatment nitric oxide shown influence dopaminergic neurotransmission striatum neuroleptic drug haloperidol block dopamine receptor also cause catalepsy rodent objective investigate effect subchronic lnoarg treatment haloperidolinduced catalepsy number no neuron area related motor control method male albino swiss mouse treated subchronically twice day day lnoarg mgkg haloperidol mgkg catalepsy evaluated beginning end treatment reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatediaphorase nadphd histochemistry also employed visualize no index enzyme expression mouse brain region related motor control result lnoarg subchronic administration produced tolerance lnoarg haloperidolinduced catalepsy also induced increase number nadphdpositive cell dorsal part caudate accumbens nucleus compared haloperidol pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared saline contrast decrease nadphd neuron number substantia nigra par compacta haloperidoltreated lnoargtreated animal conclusion result give support hypothesis play role motor behavior control suggest may take part synaptic change produced antipsychotic treatment;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Correlation between the location of germ-line mutations in the APC gene and the number of colorectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis patients.;"Recently we have isolated the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene which causes familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , and its germ-line mutations in a substantial number of FAP patients have been identified . On the basis of this information , we compared the location of germ-line mutations in the APC gene in 22 unrelated patients ( 12 of whom have been reported previously ) with the number of colorectal polyps developed in FAP patients ; 17 were sparse types and five were profuse types . All but one of the mutations were considered to cause truncation of the gene product by frame-shift due to deletion ( 14 cases ) or nonsense mutation ( seven cases ) . The location of the germ-line mutations seems to correlate with the two clinical types ; germ-line mutations in five FAP patients with profuse polyps were observed between codon 1250 and codon 1464 , whereas mutations in 17 FAP patients with fewer polyps were observed in the other regions of the APC gene . The result suggests that the number of colorectal polyps in FAP patients may be associated with a difference in the stability or biological function of the truncated APC protein . .";neurological;correlation location germline mutation apc gene number colorectal polyp familial adenomatous polyposis patient;recently isolated adenomatous polyposis coli apc gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis fap germline mutation substantial number fap patient identified basis information compared location germline mutation apc gene unrelated patient reported previously number colorectal polyp developed fap patient sparse type five profuse type one mutation considered cause truncation gene product frameshift due deletion case nonsense mutation seven case location germline mutation seems correlate two clinical type germline mutation five fap patient profuse polyp observed codon codon whereas mutation fap patient fewer polyp observed region apc gene result suggests number colorectal polyp fap patient may associated difference stability biological function truncated apc protein;correlation location germline mutation apc gene number colorectal polyp familial adenomatous polyposis patient recently isolated adenomatous polyposis coli apc gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis fap germline mutation substantial number fap patient identified basis information compared location germline mutation apc gene unrelated patient reported previously number colorectal polyp developed fap patient sparse type five profuse type one mutation considered cause truncation gene product frameshift due deletion case nonsense mutation seven case location germline mutation seems correlate two clinical type germline mutation five fap patient profuse polyp observed codon codon whereas mutation fap patient fewer polyp observed region apc gene result suggests number colorectal polyp fap patient may associated difference stability biological function truncated apc protein;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Ketamine in war/tropical surgery (a final tribute to the racemic mixture).;A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates. Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/oxygen only. After premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of ketamine, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved safe and effective. Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate. Diazepam, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations. Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia. An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate. Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.;cardiovascular;ketamine wartropical surgery final tribute racemic mixture;technique continuous intravenous anaesthesia ketamine used successfully somalia civil war north uganda operation patient aged week year undergoing limb abdominal surgery including caesarian section intervention neonate operation lasting could performed absence sophisticated equipment pulse oximeter ventilator patient spontaneous ventilation breathing airoxygen premedication diazepam glycopyrrolate local anaesthesia induction standard dos ketamine maintenance dose microgkgmin ketamine proved safe effective emphasis placed bedside clinical monitoring relying heavily heart rate diazepam unless contraindicated risky remains necessary complementary drug ketamine buffer cardiovascular response decrease duration intensity operative postoperative hallucination local anaesthetic block useful decreasing requirement postoperative analgesia antisialogue usually unnecessary operation lasting glycopyrrolate best choice lowest psychotropic chronotropic effect especially hot climate experience wartropical setting suggests technique could useful civilian context outdoor lifesaving emergency surgery mass casualty amputation rapid extrication required;ketamine wartropical surgery final tribute racemic mixture technique continuous intravenous anaesthesia ketamine used successfully somalia civil war north uganda operation patient aged week year undergoing limb abdominal surgery including caesarian section intervention neonate operation lasting could performed absence sophisticated equipment pulse oximeter ventilator patient spontaneous ventilation breathing airoxygen premedication diazepam glycopyrrolate local anaesthesia induction standard dos ketamine maintenance dose microgkgmin ketamine proved safe effective emphasis placed bedside clinical monitoring relying heavily heart rate diazepam unless contraindicated risky remains necessary complementary drug ketamine buffer cardiovascular response decrease duration intensity operative postoperative hallucination local anaesthetic block useful decreasing requirement postoperative analgesia antisialogue usually unnecessary operation lasting glycopyrrolate best choice lowest psychotropic chronotropic effect especially hot climate experience wartropical setting suggests technique could useful civilian context outdoor lifesaving emergency surgery mass casualty amputation rapid extrication required;cardiovascular;hepatorenal|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Somatic von Hippel-Lindau mutation in clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis.;Papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis is an uncommon benign lesion that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) disease . Neither immunohistochemical studies nor molecular genetic analyses of the VHL gene have been reported previously for this lesion . The authors describe two cases of clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis , both of which were initially confused with metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Both lesions showed positive immunohistochemical staining for low and intermediate molecular weight keratins ( Cam 5 . 2 and AE1 / AE3 ) , EMA , vimentin , alpha 1-antitrypsin , and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin . Each was negative for CEA . Because clear cell papillary cystadenoma is similar to renal cell carcinoma histologically , and because both occur as components of the von Hippel-Lindau disease complex , the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of mutations in the VHL gene . A somatic VHL gene mutation was detected in one of the two tumors by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis . Direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694 , resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3 .

Prolonged left ventricular dysfunction occurs in patients with coronary artery disease after both dobutamine and exercise induced myocardial ischaemia.;"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pharmacological stress leads to prolonged but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease, similar to that seen after exercise. DESIGN: A randomised crossover study of recovery time of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function after exercise and dobutamine induced ischaemia. SUBJECTS: 10 patients with stable angina, angiographically proven coronary artery disease, and normal left ventricular function. INTERVENTIONS: Treadmill exercise and dobutamine stress were performed on different days. Quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test. RESULTS: Both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction. There was no difference in the maximum double product (p = 0.53) or ST depression (p = 0.63) with either form of stress. After exercise, ejection fraction was reduced at 15 and 30 minutes compared with baseline (mean (SEM), -5.6 (1.5)%, p < 0.05; and -6.1 (2.2)%, p < 0. 01), and at 30 and 45 minutes after dobutamine (-10.8 (1.8)% and -5. 5 (1.8)%, both p < 0.01). Regional analysis showed a reduction in the worst affected segment 15 and 30 minutes after exercise (-27.9 (7.2)% and -28.6 (5.7)%, both p < 0.01), and at 30 minutes after dobutamine (-32 (5.3)%, p < 0.01). The isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged 45 minutes after each form of stress (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease, dobutamine induced ischaemia results in prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction, presumed to be myocardial stunning, similar to that seen after exercise. Dobutamine induced ischaemia could therefore be used to study the pathophysiology of this phenomenon further in patients with coronary artery disease.";neurological|cardiovascular;prolonged left ventricular dysfunction occurs patient coronary artery disease dobutamine exercise induced myocardial ischaemia;objective determine whether pharmacological stress lead prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction patient coronary artery disease similar seen exercise design randomised crossover study recovery time systolic diastolic left ventricular function exercise dobutamine induced ischaemia subject patient stable angina angiographically proven coronary artery disease normal left ventricular function intervention treadmill exercise dobutamine stress performed different day quantitative assessment systolic diastolic left ventricular function performed using transthoracic echocardiography baseline regular interval test result form stress led prolonged reversible systolic diastolic dysfunction difference maximum double product depression either form stress exercise ejection fraction reduced minute compared baseline mean sem minute dobutamine regional analysis showed reduction worst affected segment minute exercise minute dobutamine isovolumic relaxation period prolonged minute form stress conclusion patient coronary artery disease dobutamine induced ischaemia result prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction presumed myocardial stunning similar seen exercise dobutamine induced ischaemia could therefore used study pathophysiology phenomenon patient coronary artery disease;prolonged left ventricular dysfunction occurs patient coronary artery disease dobutamine exercise induced myocardial ischaemia objective determine whether pharmacological stress lead prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction patient coronary artery disease similar seen exercise design randomised crossover study recovery time systolic diastolic left ventricular function exercise dobutamine induced ischaemia subject patient stable angina angiographically proven coronary artery disease normal left ventricular function intervention treadmill exercise dobutamine stress performed different day quantitative assessment systolic diastolic left ventricular function performed using transthoracic echocardiography baseline regular interval test result form stress led prolonged reversible systolic diastolic dysfunction difference maximum double product depression either form stress exercise ejection fraction reduced minute compared baseline mean sem minute dobutamine regional analysis showed reduction worst affected segment minute exercise minute dobutamine isovolumic relaxation period prolonged minute form stress conclusion patient coronary artery disease dobutamine induced ischaemia result prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction presumed myocardial stunning similar seen exercise dobutamine induced ischaemia could therefore used study pathophysiology phenomenon patient coronary artery disease;neurological|cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked congenital thrombocytopenia are caused by mutations of the same gene.;The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia , small platelets , eczema , recurrent infections , and immunodeficiency . Besides the classic WAS phenotype , there is a group of patients with congenital X-linked thrombocytopenia ( XLT ) who have small platelets but only transient eczema , if any , and minimal immune deficiency . Because the gene responsible for WAS has been sequenced , it was possible to correlate the WAS phenotypes with WAS gene mutations . Using a fingerprinting screening technique , we determined the approximate location of the mutation in 13 unrelated WAS patients with mild to severe clinical symptoms . Direct sequence analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA obtained from patient-derived cell lines showed 12 unique mutations distributed throughout the WAS gene , including insertions , deletions , and point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions , termination , exon skipping , or splicing defects . Of 4 unrelated patients with the XLT phenotype , 3 had missense mutations affecting exon 2 and 1 had a splice-site mutation affecting exon 9 . Patients with classic WAS had more complex mutations , resulting in termination codons , frameshift , and early termination . These findings provide direct evidence that XLT and WAS are caused by mutations of the same gene and suggest that severe clinical phenotypes are associated with complex mutations . .;neurological;wiskottaldrich syndrome xlinked congenital thrombocytopenia caused mutation gene;wiskottaldrich syndrome xlinked recessive disorder characterized thrombocytopenia small platelet eczema recurrent infection immunodeficiency besides classic phenotype group patient congenital xlinked thrombocytopenia xlt small platelet transient eczema minimal immune deficiency gene responsible sequenced possible correlate phenotype gene mutation using fingerprinting screening technique determined approximate location mutation unrelated patient mild severe clinical symptom direct sequence analysis cdna genomic dna obtained patientderived cell line showed unique mutation distributed throughout gene including insertion deletion point mutation resulting amino acid substitution termination exon skipping splicing defect unrelated patient xlt phenotype missense mutation affecting exon splicesite mutation affecting exon patient classic complex mutation resulting termination codon frameshift early termination finding provide direct evidence xlt caused mutation gene suggest severe clinical phenotype associated complex mutation;wiskottaldrich syndrome xlinked congenital thrombocytopenia caused mutation gene wiskottaldrich syndrome xlinked recessive disorder characterized thrombocytopenia small platelet eczema recurrent infection immunodeficiency besides classic phenotype group patient congenital xlinked thrombocytopenia xlt small platelet transient eczema minimal immune deficiency gene responsible sequenced possible correlate phenotype gene mutation using fingerprinting screening technique determined approximate location mutation unrelated patient mild severe clinical symptom direct sequence analysis cdna genomic dna obtained patientderived cell line showed unique mutation distributed throughout gene including insertion deletion point mutation resulting amino acid substitution termination exon skipping splicing defect unrelated patient xlt phenotype missense mutation affecting exon splicesite mutation affecting exon patient classic complex mutation resulting termination codon frameshift early termination finding provide direct evidence xlt caused mutation gene suggest severe clinical phenotype associated complex mutation;neurological;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpretation.;Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported. In one patient, enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures. Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified, the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants. Two other patients suffered from partial, complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication. Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure-free. Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG. On the other hand, enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings.;neurological;epileptogenic property enflurane clinical interpretation;three case eeg change induced single exposure enflurane anesthesia reported one patient enflurane administered donor nephrectomy resulted unexpected partial motor seizure cause seizure correctly identified patient inappropriately treated anticonvulsant two patient suffered partial complex generalized seizure uncontrolled medication epileptic focus delineated activated enflurane surgically ablated patient seizurefree previous exposure enflurane disclosed avoid mistake clinical interpretation eeg hand enflurane may prove safe fast acting activator epileptic focus corticography depth electrode intraoperative recording;epileptogenic property enflurane clinical interpretation three case eeg change induced single exposure enflurane anesthesia reported one patient enflurane administered donor nephrectomy resulted unexpected partial motor seizure cause seizure correctly identified patient inappropriately treated anticonvulsant two patient suffered partial complex generalized seizure uncontrolled medication epileptic focus delineated activated enflurane surgically ablated patient seizurefree previous exposure enflurane disclosed avoid mistake clinical interpretation eeg hand enflurane may prove safe fast acting activator epileptic focus corticography depth electrode intraoperative recording;neurological;none;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Cauda equina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine: a review of six cases of cauda equina syndrome reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993-1997.;Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997. All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. Five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block. The dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. In the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology. All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits. We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.;neurological;cauda equina syndrome spinal anaesthesia hyperbaric lignocaine review six case cauda equina syndrome reported swedish pharmaceutical insurance;six case cauda equina syndrome varying severity reported swedish pharmaceutical insurance period associated spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric lignocaine five case singleshot spinal anaesthesia one repeat spinal anaesthetic due inadequate block dose hyperbaric lignocaine administered ranged three case likely caused direct neurotoxicity hyperbaric lignocaine case direct neurotoxicity also probable unfortunately radiological investigation done definitely exclude compressive aetiology case sustained permanent neurological deficit recommend hyperbaric lignocaine administered concentration greater total dose preferably exceeding;cauda equina syndrome spinal anaesthesia hyperbaric lignocaine review six case cauda equina syndrome reported swedish pharmaceutical insurance six case cauda equina syndrome varying severity reported swedish pharmaceutical insurance period associated spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric lignocaine five case singleshot spinal anaesthesia one repeat spinal anaesthetic due inadequate block dose hyperbaric lignocaine administered ranged three case likely caused direct neurotoxicity hyperbaric lignocaine case direct neurotoxicity also probable unfortunately radiological investigation done definitely exclude compressive aetiology case sustained permanent neurological deficit recommend hyperbaric lignocaine administered concentration greater total dose preferably exceeding;neurological;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Long-term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of paclitaxel.;"Toxic peripheral neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel (PAC), although glutamate and its closely related amino acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate PAC neurotoxicity. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing PAC-induced peripheral neuropathy in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study. Forty-three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC-containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group G), and 20 had received a placebo (group P). Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations, questionnaires and sensory-motor nerve conduction studies. There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G. However, this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation (P = 0.011). Also the frequency of abnormal electro-diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups (G: 7/23 = 30.4%; P: 6/20 = 30%). This pilot study leads to the conclusion that glutamate supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of PAC.";neurological|oncological;longterm glutamate supplementation failed protect peripheral neurotoxicity paclitaxel;toxic peripheral neuropathy still significant limiting factor chemotherapy paclitaxel pac although glutamate closely related amino acid glutamine claimed ameliorate pac neurotoxicity pilot trial aimed evaluate role glutamate supplementation preventing pacinduced peripheral neuropathy randomized placebocontrolled doubleblinded clinical electrodiagnostic study fortythree ovarian cancer patient available analysis following six cycle paccontaining regimen supplemented glutamate along treatment period daily dose three time group received placebo group patient evaluated neurological examination questionnaire sensorymotor nerve conduction study significant difference frequency sign symptom two group although neurotoxicity symptom presented mostly lower score severity group however difference reached statistical significance regard reported pain sensation also frequency abnormal electrodiagnostic finding showed similarity two group pilot study lead conclusion glutamate supplementation chosen regimen fails protect peripheral neurotoxicity pac;longterm glutamate supplementation failed protect peripheral neurotoxicity paclitaxel toxic peripheral neuropathy still significant limiting factor chemotherapy paclitaxel pac although glutamate closely related amino acid glutamine claimed ameliorate pac neurotoxicity pilot trial aimed evaluate role glutamate supplementation preventing pacinduced peripheral neuropathy randomized placebocontrolled doubleblinded clinical electrodiagnostic study fortythree ovarian cancer patient available analysis following six cycle paccontaining regimen supplemented glutamate along treatment period daily dose three time group received placebo group patient evaluated neurological examination questionnaire sensorymotor nerve conduction study significant difference frequency sign symptom two group although neurotoxicity symptom presented mostly lower score severity group however difference reached statistical significance regard reported pain sensation also frequency abnormal electrodiagnostic finding showed similarity two group pilot study lead conclusion glutamate supplementation chosen regimen fails protect peripheral neurotoxicity pac;neurological|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Cardiac toxicity observed in association with high-dose cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.;"INTRODUCTION: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy. STUDY DESIGN: We combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (CHF) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation. RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients. Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development.";cardiovascular|oncological;cardiac toxicity observed association highdose cyclophosphamidebased chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer;introduction cyclophosphamide alkylating agent given frequently component many conditioning regimen high dos nonhematological doselimiting toxicity cardiomyopathy study design combined paclitaxel melphalan highdose cyclophosphamide thiotepa carboplatin triple sequential highdose regimen patient metastatic breast cancer analysis performed woman chemotherapyresponsive metastatic breast cancer receiving infusional cyclophosphamide part triple sequential highdose regimen assess association presence peritransplant congestive heart failure chf following pretreatment characteristic presence electrocardiogram ekg abnormality age hypertension prior cardiac history smoking diabetes mellitus prior use anthracyclines leftsided chest irradiation result six woman developed clinically reversible grade chf following infusional cyclophosphamide median percent decline ejection fraction incidence transient cyclophosphamiderelated cardiac toxicity comparable previous recorded literature older age significantly correlated chf development median age entire group patient developing chf respectively association found pretreatment characteristic conclusion result finding oncologist carefully monitor fluid balance older patient routine ekg monitoring infusional cyclophosphamide predict chf development;cardiac toxicity observed association highdose cyclophosphamidebased chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer introduction cyclophosphamide alkylating agent given frequently component many conditioning regimen high dos nonhematological doselimiting toxicity cardiomyopathy study design combined paclitaxel melphalan highdose cyclophosphamide thiotepa carboplatin triple sequential highdose regimen patient metastatic breast cancer analysis performed woman chemotherapyresponsive metastatic breast cancer receiving infusional cyclophosphamide part triple sequential highdose regimen assess association presence peritransplant congestive heart failure chf following pretreatment characteristic presence electrocardiogram ekg abnormality age hypertension prior cardiac history smoking diabetes mellitus prior use anthracyclines leftsided chest irradiation result six woman developed clinically reversible grade chf following infusional cyclophosphamide median percent decline ejection fraction incidence transient cyclophosphamiderelated cardiac toxicity comparable previous recorded literature older age significantly correlated chf development median age entire group patient developing chf respectively association found pretreatment characteristic conclusion result finding oncologist carefully monitor fluid balance older patient routine ekg monitoring infusional cyclophosphamide predict chf development;cardiovascular|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs.;The effects of i.v. bolus administration of cromakalim (1-10 micrograms/kg) and pinacidil (3-100 micrograms/kg) on large (circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin (0.03-10 micrograms/kg). Nitroglycerin, up to 0.3 micrograms/kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter (CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter. In contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure. Cromakalim was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD. Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug-induced tachycardia was abolished. When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim (10 micrograms/kg), pinacidil (30 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg) were reduced by 68 +/- 7, 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1%, respectively. Thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand. Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim- and pinacidil-induced increase in CxAD.;neurological|cardiovascular;effect cromakalim pinacidil large epicardial small coronary artery conscious dog;effect bolus administration cromakalim microgramskg pinacidil microgramskg large circumflex artery small coronary artery systemic hemodynamics investigated chronically instrumented conscious dog compared nitroglycerin microgramskg nitroglycerin microgramskg selectively increased circumflex artery diameter cxad without simultaneously affecting cardiac systemic hemodynamic parameter contrast cromakalim pinacidil dos nitroglycerin dos higher microgramskg simultaneously dosedependently increased cxad coronary blood flow heart rate decreased coronary vascular resistance aortic pressure cromakalim approximately fold potent pinacidil increasing cxad vasodilation large small coronary vessel hypotension induced cromakalim pinacidil affected prior combined beta adrenergic muscarinic receptor blockade druginduced tachycardia abolished circumflex artery blood flow maintained constant increase cxad induced cromakalim microgramskg pinacidil microgramskg nitroglycerin microgramskg reduced respectively thus whereas nitroglycerin preferentially flowindependently dilates large coronary artery cromakalim pinacidil dilate large small coronary artery effect dependent upon simultaneous beta adrenoceptorsmediated rise myocardial metabolic demand finally two mechanism least direct vasodilation flow dependency involved cromakalim pinacidilinduced increase cxad;effect cromakalim pinacidil large epicardial small coronary artery conscious dog effect bolus administration cromakalim microgramskg pinacidil microgramskg large circumflex artery small coronary artery systemic hemodynamics investigated chronically instrumented conscious dog compared nitroglycerin microgramskg nitroglycerin microgramskg selectively increased circumflex artery diameter cxad without simultaneously affecting cardiac systemic hemodynamic parameter contrast cromakalim pinacidil dos nitroglycerin dos higher microgramskg simultaneously dosedependently increased cxad coronary blood flow heart rate decreased coronary vascular resistance aortic pressure cromakalim approximately fold potent pinacidil increasing cxad vasodilation large small coronary vessel hypotension induced cromakalim pinacidil affected prior combined beta adrenergic muscarinic receptor blockade druginduced tachycardia abolished circumflex artery blood flow maintained constant increase cxad induced cromakalim microgramskg pinacidil microgramskg nitroglycerin microgramskg reduced respectively thus whereas nitroglycerin preferentially flowindependently dilates large coronary artery cromakalim pinacidil dilate large small coronary artery effect dependent upon simultaneous beta adrenoceptorsmediated rise myocardial metabolic demand finally two mechanism least direct vasodilation flow dependency involved cromakalim pinacidilinduced increase cxad;neurological|cardiovascular;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Compression neuropathy of the radial nerve due to pentazocine-induced fibrous myopathy.;Fibrous myopathy is a common, well-known side effect of repeated pentazocine injection. However, compression neuropathy due to fibrotic muscle affected by pentazocine-induced myopathy has not previously been reported. In a 37-year-old woman with documented pentazocine-induced fibrous myopathy of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three-week history of right wrist drop, electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps, in addition to the fibrous myopathy.

Seizure resulting from a venlafaxine overdose.;OBJECTIVE: To report a case of venlafaxine overdose. CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt. After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, venlafaxine was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure. Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted. CONCLUSIONS: The venlafaxine overdose in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized seizure but elicited no further sequelae.;neurological;seizure resulting venlafaxine overdose;objective report case venlafaxine overdose case summary yearold woman major depression took overdose venlafaxine apparent suicide attempt ingestion venlafaxine tablet patient experienced witnessed generalized seizure admitted medical intensive care unit venlafaxine discontinued sequela seen discussion knowledge first reported case venlafaxine overdose resulted generalized seizure based nonoverdose pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics venlafaxine potential risk available intervention emergent therapy instituted conclusion venlafaxine overdose patient resulted single episode generalized seizure elicited sequela;seizure resulting venlafaxine overdose objective report case venlafaxine overdose case summary yearold woman major depression took overdose venlafaxine apparent suicide attempt ingestion venlafaxine tablet patient experienced witnessed generalized seizure admitted medical intensive care unit venlafaxine discontinued sequela seen discussion knowledge first reported case venlafaxine overdose resulted generalized seizure based nonoverdose pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics venlafaxine potential risk available intervention emergent therapy instituted conclusion venlafaxine overdose patient resulted single episode generalized seizure elicited sequela;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Statistical analysis of the two stage mutation model in von Hippel-Lindau disease, and in sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma.;Analysis of the age incidence curves for unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma led Knudson to propose that hereditary tumours may arise by a single event and sporadic tumours by a two stage mutation process . It has been suggested recently that sporadic renal cell carcinoma may arise from a two stage mutation process . We analysed the age incidence curves for symptomatic renal cell carcinoma ( n = 26 ) and cerebellar haemangioblastoma ( n = 68 ) in 109 patients with von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) disease , and compared them to 104 patients with sporadic renal cell carcinoma and 43 patients with sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma . The age incidence curves for renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma in VHL disease were compatible with a single mutation model , whereas the age incidence curves for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested a two stage mutation process . These data are compatible with the VHL gene functioning as a recessive tumour suppressor gene . Sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma and some renal cell carcinoma may arise from somatic mutations inactivating both alleles at the VHL locus . .;hepatorenal|oncological;statistical analysis two stage mutation model von hippellindau disease sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma renal cell carcinoma;analysis age incidence curve unilateral bilateral retinoblastoma led knudson propose hereditary tumour may arise single event sporadic tumour two stage mutation process suggested recently sporadic renal cell carcinoma may arise two stage mutation process analysed age incidence curve symptomatic renal cell carcinoma cerebellar haemangioblastoma patient von hippellindau vhl disease compared patient sporadic renal cell carcinoma patient sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma age incidence curve renal cell carcinoma cerebellar haemangioblastoma vhl disease compatible single mutation model whereas age incidence curve sporadic renal cell carcinoma cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested two stage mutation process data compatible vhl gene functioning recessive tumour suppressor gene sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma renal cell carcinoma may arise somatic mutation inactivating allele vhl locus;statistical analysis two stage mutation model von hippellindau disease sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma renal cell carcinoma analysis age incidence curve unilateral bilateral retinoblastoma led knudson propose hereditary tumour may arise single event sporadic tumour two stage mutation process suggested recently sporadic renal cell carcinoma may arise two stage mutation process analysed age incidence curve symptomatic renal cell carcinoma cerebellar haemangioblastoma patient von hippellindau vhl disease compared patient sporadic renal cell carcinoma patient sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma age incidence curve renal cell carcinoma cerebellar haemangioblastoma vhl disease compatible single mutation model whereas age incidence curve sporadic renal cell carcinoma cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested two stage mutation process data compatible vhl gene functioning recessive tumour suppressor gene sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma renal cell carcinoma may arise somatic mutation inactivating allele vhl locus;hepatorenal|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Paternal transmission of congenital myotonic dystrophy.;We report a rare case of paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) . The proband is a 23 year old , mentally retarded male who suffers severe muscular weakness . He presented with respiratory and feeding difficulties at birth . His two sibs suffer from childhood onset DM . Their late father had the adult type of DM , with onset around 30 years . Only six other cases of paternal transmission of congenital DM have been reported recently . We review the sex related effects on transmission of congenital DM . Decreased fertility of males with adult onset DM and contraction of the repeat upon male transmission contribute to the almost absent occurrence of paternal transmission of congenital DM . Also the fathers of the reported congenitally affected children showed , on average , shorter CTG repeat lengths and hence less severe clinical symptoms than the mothers of children with congenital DM . We conclude that paternal transmission of congenital DM is rare and preferentially occurs with onset of DM past 30 years in the father . .;neurological;paternal transmission congenital myotonic dystrophy;report rare case paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy proband year old mentally retarded male suffers severe muscular weakness presented respiratory feeding difficulty birth two sib suffer childhood onset late father adult type onset around year six case paternal transmission congenital reported recently review sex related effect transmission congenital decreased fertility male adult onset contraction repeat upon male transmission contribute almost absent occurrence paternal transmission congenital also father reported congenitally affected child showed average shorter ctg repeat length hence less severe clinical symptom mother child congenital conclude paternal transmission congenital rare preferentially occurs onset past year father;paternal transmission congenital myotonic dystrophy report rare case paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy proband year old mentally retarded male suffers severe muscular weakness presented respiratory feeding difficulty birth two sib suffer childhood onset late father adult type onset around year six case paternal transmission congenital reported recently review sex related effect transmission congenital decreased fertility male adult onset contraction repeat upon male transmission contribute almost absent occurrence paternal transmission congenital also father reported congenitally affected child showed average shorter ctg repeat length hence less severe clinical symptom mother child congenital conclude paternal transmission congenital rare preferentially occurs onset past year father;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity.;Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats. The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;biochemical effect solidago virgaurea extract experimental cardiotoxicity;cardiovascular disease cvds major health problem advanced well developing country world aim present study investigate protective effect solidago virgaurea extract isoproterenolinduced cardiotoxicity rat subcutaneous injection isoproterenol mgkg rat twice interval two consecutive day led significant increase serum lactate dehydrogenase creatine phosphokinase alanine transaminase aspartate transaminase angiotensinconverting enzyme activity total cholesterol triglyceride free serum fatty acid cardiac tissue malondialdehyde mda nitric oxide level significant decrease level glutathione superoxide dismutase cardiac tissue compared normal control group pretreatment virgaurea extract week dose mgkg followed isoproterenol injection significantly prevented observed alteration captopril mgkgday given orally inhibitor angiotensinconverting enzyme used standard cardioprotective drug used positive control study data present study suggest virgaurea extract exerts protective effect decreasing mda level increasing antioxidant status isoproterenoltreated rat study emphasizes beneficial action virgaurea extract cardioprotective agent;biochemical effect solidago virgaurea extract experimental cardiotoxicity cardiovascular disease cvds major health problem advanced well developing country world aim present study investigate protective effect solidago virgaurea extract isoproterenolinduced cardiotoxicity rat subcutaneous injection isoproterenol mgkg rat twice interval two consecutive day led significant increase serum lactate dehydrogenase creatine phosphokinase alanine transaminase aspartate transaminase angiotensinconverting enzyme activity total cholesterol triglyceride free serum fatty acid cardiac tissue malondialdehyde mda nitric oxide level significant decrease level glutathione superoxide dismutase cardiac tissue compared normal control group pretreatment virgaurea extract week dose mgkg followed isoproterenol injection significantly prevented observed alteration captopril mgkgday given orally inhibitor angiotensinconverting enzyme used standard cardioprotective drug used positive control study data present study suggest virgaurea extract exerts protective effect decreasing mda level increasing antioxidant status isoproterenoltreated rat study emphasizes beneficial action virgaurea extract cardioprotective agent;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Analysis of meiotic segregation, using single-sperm typing: meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy locus.;Meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency , in the human population , of DM chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state . In order to test this hypothesis , we have studied samples of single sperm from three individuals heterozygous at the DM locus , each with one allele larger and one allele smaller than 19 CTG repeats . To guard against the possible problem of differential PCR amplification rates based on the lengths of the alleles , the sperm were also typed at another closely linked marker whose allele size was unrelated to the allele size at the DM locus . Using statistical models specifically designed to study single-sperm segregation data , we find no evidence of meiotic segregation distortion . The upper limit of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the estimate of the common segregation probability for the three donors is at or below . 515 for all models considered , and no statistically significant difference from . 5 is detected in any of the models . This suggests that any greater amount of segregation distortion at the myotonic dystrophy locus must result from events following sperm ejaculation .;neurological;analysis meiotic segregation using singlesperm typing meiotic drive myotonic dystrophy locus;meiotic drive myotonic dystrophy locus recently suggested responsible maintaining frequency human population chromosome capable expansion disease state order test hypothesis studied sample single sperm three individual heterozygous locus one allele larger one allele smaller ctg repeat guard possible problem differential pcr amplification rate based length allele sperm also typed another closely linked marker whose allele size unrelated allele size locus using statistical model specifically designed study singlesperm segregation data find evidence meiotic segregation distortion upper limit twosided confidence interval estimate common segregation probability three donor model considered statistically significant difference detected model suggests greater amount segregation distortion myotonic dystrophy locus must result event following sperm ejaculation;analysis meiotic segregation using singlesperm typing meiotic drive myotonic dystrophy locus meiotic drive myotonic dystrophy locus recently suggested responsible maintaining frequency human population chromosome capable expansion disease state order test hypothesis studied sample single sperm three individual heterozygous locus one allele larger one allele smaller ctg repeat guard possible problem differential pcr amplification rate based length allele sperm also typed another closely linked marker whose allele size unrelated allele size locus using statistical model specifically designed study singlesperm segregation data find evidence meiotic segregation distortion upper limit twosided confidence interval estimate common segregation probability three donor model considered statistically significant difference detected model suggests greater amount segregation distortion myotonic dystrophy locus must result event following sperm ejaculation;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Pharmacokinetics of chlorpheniramine, phenytoin, glipizide and nifedipine in an individual homozygous for the CYP2C9*3 allele.;Genetic polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) family are widely known to contribute to interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of many drugs . Several alleles for the CYP2C9 gene have been reported . Individuals homozygous for the Leu359 variant ( CYP2C9 * 3 ) have been shown to have significantly lower drug clearances compared with Ile359 ( CYP2C9 * 1 ) homozygous individuals . A male Caucasian who participated in six bioavailability studies in our laboratory over a period of several years showed extremely low clearance of two drugs  phenytoin and glipizide ( both substrates of CYP2C9 ) , but not for nifedipine ( a CYP3A4 substrate ) and chlorpheniramine ( a CYP2D6 substrate ) . His oral clearance of phenytoin was 21 % of the mean of the other 11 individuals participating in the study , and his oral clearance of glipizide , a second generation sulfonylurea structurally similar to tolbutamide , was only 188 % of the mean of the other 10 individuals . However , his oral clearance of nifedipine and chlorpheniramine did not differ from individuals in other studies performed at our laboratories . An additional blood sample was obtained from this individual to determine if he possessed any of the known CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 allelic variants that would account for his poor clearance of the CYP2C9 substrates ( phenytoin and glipizide ) compared with the CYP3A4 ( nifedipine ) and CYP2D6 ( chlorpheniramine ) substrates . The results of the genotype testing showed that this individual was homozygous for the CYP2C9 * 3 allele and did not possess any of the known defective CYP2C19 alleles .

Toxicity in rhesus monkeys following administration of the 8-aminoquinoline 8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline (WR242511).;"INTRODUCTION: Many substances that form methemoglobin (MHb) effectively counter cyanide (CN) toxicity. Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment. Using this rationale, the 8-aminoquinoline WR242511, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment. METHODS: In this study, WR242511 was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received WR242511 orally (PO) at 7.0 mg/kg. Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure. RESULTS: The selected doses of WR242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. Furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and/or indirect drug-induced toxicity. It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti-CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity.";hepatorenal;toxicity rhesus monkey following administration aminoquinoline aminolmethylbutylamino lhexyloxymethoxymethylquinoline;introduction many substance form methemoglobin mhb effectively counter cyanide toxicity although mhb former generally applied treatment poisoning proposed stable longacting mhb former could serve pretreatment using rationale aminoquinoline potent longlasting mhb former rodent beagle dog studied rhesus monkey advanced development potential pretreatment method study administered intravenously female male rhesus monkey dos andor mgkg single male also received orally mgkg health status mhb level monitored following exposure result selected dos produced significant methemoglobinemia beagle dog earlier study conducted elsewhere produced little mhb mean rhesus monkey furthermore transient hemoglobinuria noted approximately minute postinjection mgkg lethality occurred one one following mgkg dose myoglobinuria also observed following mgkg dose histopathology analysis animal died revealed liver kidney toxicity greater severity orallytreated animal conclusion data demonstrate direct andor indirect druginduced toxicity concluded pursued pretreatment poisoning unless anticn characteristic compound successfully dissociated producing undesirable toxicity;toxicity rhesus monkey following administration aminoquinoline aminolmethylbutylamino lhexyloxymethoxymethylquinoline introduction many substance form methemoglobin mhb effectively counter cyanide toxicity although mhb former generally applied treatment poisoning proposed stable longacting mhb former could serve pretreatment using rationale aminoquinoline potent longlasting mhb former rodent beagle dog studied rhesus monkey advanced development potential pretreatment method study administered intravenously female male rhesus monkey dos andor mgkg single male also received orally mgkg health status mhb level monitored following exposure result selected dos produced significant methemoglobinemia beagle dog earlier study conducted elsewhere produced little mhb mean rhesus monkey furthermore transient hemoglobinuria noted approximately minute postinjection mgkg lethality occurred one one following mgkg dose myoglobinuria also observed following mgkg dose histopathology analysis animal died revealed liver kidney toxicity greater severity orallytreated animal conclusion data demonstrate direct andor indirect druginduced toxicity concluded pursued pretreatment poisoning unless anticn characteristic compound successfully dissociated producing undesirable toxicity;hepatorenal;cardiovascular|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.;A 61-year-old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy. The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. After discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis. Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. This report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure.;hepatorenal;massive proteinuria acute renal failure oral bisphosphonate alendronate administration patient focal segmental glomerulosclerosis;yearold japanese man nephrotic syndrome due focal segmental glomerulosclerosis initially responding well steroid therapy amount daily urinary protein decreased within day oral bisphosphonate alendronate sodium administration amount daily urinary protein increased rapidly acute renal failure discontinuing oral alendronate patient underwent six cycle hemodialysis four cycle ldl apheresis urinary volume serum creatinine level recovered normal range urinary protein disappearing completely within day report demonstrates intravenous also oral bisphosphonates aggravate proteinuria acute renal failure;massive proteinuria acute renal failure oral bisphosphonate alendronate administration patient focal segmental glomerulosclerosis yearold japanese man nephrotic syndrome due focal segmental glomerulosclerosis initially responding well steroid therapy amount daily urinary protein decreased within day oral bisphosphonate alendronate sodium administration amount daily urinary protein increased rapidly acute renal failure discontinuing oral alendronate patient underwent six cycle hemodialysis four cycle ldl apheresis urinary volume serum creatinine level recovered normal range urinary protein disappearing completely within day report demonstrates intravenous also oral bisphosphonates aggravate proteinuria acute renal failure;hepatorenal;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Cis and trans effects of the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) mutation in a cell culture model.;The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as a CTG expansion in the 3-untranslated region ( 3-UTR ) of the DM protein kinase gene ( DMPK ) , but the mechanism ( s ) of pathogenesis remain unknown . Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results . Therefore , to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment , we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts . By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3-UTR , we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation . Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3-UTR , with as few as 57 CTGs , had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci . We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded ( CTG ) ( n ) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects . Furthermore , in contrast to the normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA , a mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA with ( CUG ) ( 200 ) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts . Genetic analysis and the Cre- loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript . Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion and / or the 3 end of the DMPK 3-UTR . These results provide evidence that the DM mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production ( consistent with DMPK haploinsufficiency ) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis . .;neurological;ci trans effect myotonic dystrophy mutation cell culture model;mutation causing myotonic dystrophy identified ctg expansion untranslated region utr protein kinase gene dmpk mechanism pathogenesis remain unknown study using patient material often produced confusing result therefore study effect mutation controlled environment established cell culture model system using mouse myoblasts expressing chimeric reporter construct containing reporter gene fused human dmpk utr identified ci trans effect mediated mutation data show mutant dmpk utr ctgs negative ci effect protein expression resulted aggregation reporter transcript discrete nuclear focus determined deletion analysis expanded ctg tract alone sufficient mediate ci effect furthermore contrast normal dmpk utr mrna mutant dmpk utr mrna cug selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation myoblasts genetic analysis cre loxp system used clearly demonstrate myoblast fusion defect could rescued eliminating expression mutant dmpk utr transcript characterization spontaneous deletion event mapped inhibitory effect ctg expansion end dmpk utr result provide evidence mutation act ci reduce protein production consistent dmpk haploinsufficiency trans riboregulator inhibit myogenesis;ci trans effect myotonic dystrophy mutation cell culture model mutation causing myotonic dystrophy identified ctg expansion untranslated region utr protein kinase gene dmpk mechanism pathogenesis remain unknown study using patient material often produced confusing result therefore study effect mutation controlled environment established cell culture model system using mouse myoblasts expressing chimeric reporter construct containing reporter gene fused human dmpk utr identified ci trans effect mediated mutation data show mutant dmpk utr ctgs negative ci effect protein expression resulted aggregation reporter transcript discrete nuclear focus determined deletion analysis expanded ctg tract alone sufficient mediate ci effect furthermore contrast normal dmpk utr mrna mutant dmpk utr mrna cug selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation myoblasts genetic analysis cre loxp system used clearly demonstrate myoblast fusion defect could rescued eliminating expression mutant dmpk utr transcript characterization spontaneous deletion event mapped inhibitory effect ctg expansion end dmpk utr result provide evidence mutation act ci reduce protein production consistent dmpk haploinsufficiency trans riboregulator inhibit myogenesis;neurological;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effect of calcium chloride on gross behavioural changes produced by carbachol and eserine in cats.;"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system.";cardiovascular;effect calcium chloride gross behavioural change produced carbachol eserine cat;effect calcium chloride injected cerebral ventricle grouphoused unanaesthetized cat upon vocalization rage hissing snarling fighting attack paw claw defense paw claw biting mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsion produced carbachol eserine injected similarly investigated calcium chloride depressed almost completely abolished vocalization fighting due carbachol eserine hand mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsion evoked carbachol eserine significantly changed calcium chloride apparent calcium chloride dissociate vocalization fighting autonomic motor phenomenon mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsion caused carbachol eserine calcium chloride inhibited vocalization fighting produced carbachol eserine probably nonspecific stabilizing action central muscarinic cholinoceptive site result support view calcium ion excess atropinelike action also central nervous system;effect calcium chloride gross behavioural change produced carbachol eserine cat effect calcium chloride injected cerebral ventricle grouphoused unanaesthetized cat upon vocalization rage hissing snarling fighting attack paw claw defense paw claw biting mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsion produced carbachol eserine injected similarly investigated calcium chloride depressed almost completely abolished vocalization fighting due carbachol eserine hand mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsion evoked carbachol eserine significantly changed calcium chloride apparent calcium chloride dissociate vocalization fighting autonomic motor phenomenon mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsion caused carbachol eserine calcium chloride inhibited vocalization fighting produced carbachol eserine probably nonspecific stabilizing action central muscarinic cholinoceptive site result support view calcium ion excess atropinelike action also central nervous system;cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

"Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome: a case for ""lumping"".";Recent studies demonstrated the existence of a genetically distinct , usually lethal form of the Schwartz-Jampel syndrome ( SJS ) of myotonia and skeletal dysplasia , which we called SJS type 2 . This disorder is reminiscent of another rare condition , the Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome ( SWS ) , which comprises campomelia at birth with skeletal dysplasia , contractures , and early death . To test for possible nosologic identity between these disorders , we reviewed the literature and obtained a follow-up of the only two surviving patients , one with SJS type 2 at age 10 years and another with SWS at age 7 years . Patients reported as having either neonatal SJS or SWS presented a combination of a severe , prenatal-onset neuromuscular disorder ( with congenital joint contractures , respiratory and feeding difficulties , tendency to hyperthermia , and frequent death in infancy ) with a distinct campomelic-metaphyseal skeletal dysplasia . The similarity of the clinical and radiographic findings is so extensive that these disorders appear to be a single entity . The follow-up observation of an identical and unique pattern of progressive bone dysplasia in the two patients ( one with SJS type 2 , one with SWS ) surviving beyond infancy adds to the evidence in favor of identity .

Convulsant effect of lindane and regional brain concentration of GABA and dopamine.;Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is an organochlorine insecticide with known neurotoxic effects. Its mechanism of action is not well understood although it has been proposed that lindane acts as a non-competitive antagonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor. We studied the effect of lindane (150 mg/kg) on the GABAergic and dopaminergic systems by measuring the concentration of GABA, dopamine and its metabolites in 7 brain areas at the onset of seizures. All animals suffered tonic convulsions at 18.3 +/- 1.4 min after lindane administration. The concentration of GABA was only slightly but significantly decreased in the colliculi without modifications in the other areas. The concentration of dopamine was increased in the mesencephalon and that of its metabolite DOPAC was also increased in the mesencephalon and the striatum.;neurological;convulsant effect lindane regional brain concentration gaba dopamine;lindane gammahexachlorocyclohexane organochlorine insecticide known neurotoxic effect mechanism action well understood although proposed lindane act noncompetitive antagonist gammaaminobutyric acid gabaa receptor studied effect lindane mgkg gabaergic dopaminergic system measuring concentration gaba dopamine metabolite brain area onset seizure animal suffered tonic convulsion min lindane administration concentration gaba slightly significantly decreased colliculi without modification area concentration dopamine increased mesencephalon metabolite dopac also increased mesencephalon striatum;convulsant effect lindane regional brain concentration gaba dopamine lindane gammahexachlorocyclohexane organochlorine insecticide known neurotoxic effect mechanism action well understood although proposed lindane act noncompetitive antagonist gammaaminobutyric acid gabaa receptor studied effect lindane mgkg gabaergic dopaminergic system measuring concentration gaba dopamine metabolite brain area onset seizure animal suffered tonic convulsion min lindane administration concentration gaba slightly significantly decreased colliculi without modification area concentration dopamine increased mesencephalon metabolite dopac also increased mesencephalon striatum;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
The exon 13 duplication in the BRCA1 gene is a founder mutation present in geographically diverse populations.;The BRCA1 Exon 13 Duplication Screening Group. Recently , a 6-kb duplication of exon 13 , which creates a frameshift in the coding sequence of the BRCA1 gene , has been described in three unrelated U . S S . families of European ancestry and in one Portuguese family . Here , our goal was to estimate the frequency and geographic diversity of carriers of this duplication . To do this , a collaborative screening study was set up that involved 39 institutions from 19 countries and included 3 , 580 unrelated individuals with a family history of the disease and 934 early-onset breast and / or ovarian cancer cases .

Does domperidone potentiate mirtazapine-associated restless legs syndrome?;There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome (RLS). For example, the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms. To our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS. Mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications. The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy. Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS. However, physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine can be associated with RLS in some individuals, especially those receiving concomitant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists.;neurological;domperidone potentiate mirtazapineassociated restless leg syndrome;evidence suggest central role dopaminergic system restless leg syndrome rls example symptom rls dramatically improved levodopa dopamine agonist whereas central dopamine receptor antagonist induce aggravate rls symptom knowledge previous report regarding whether domperidone peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist also induce aggravate symptom rls mirtazapine first noradrenergic specific serotonergic antidepressant nassa associated rls several recent publication author report depressed patient comorbid postprandial dyspepsia developed rls mirtazapine added domperidone therapy patient started symptom rls treated mirtazapine rls symptom resolved completely upon discontinuation mirtazapine temporal relationship use mirtazapine symptom rls patient support potentiating effect domperione mirtazapineassociated rls however physician aware possibility mirtazapine associated rls individual especially receiving concomitant dopamine receptor antagonist;domperidone potentiate mirtazapineassociated restless leg syndrome evidence suggest central role dopaminergic system restless leg syndrome rls example symptom rls dramatically improved levodopa dopamine agonist whereas central dopamine receptor antagonist induce aggravate rls symptom knowledge previous report regarding whether domperidone peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist also induce aggravate symptom rls mirtazapine first noradrenergic specific serotonergic antidepressant nassa associated rls several recent publication author report depressed patient comorbid postprandial dyspepsia developed rls mirtazapine added domperidone therapy patient started symptom rls treated mirtazapine rls symptom resolved completely upon discontinuation mirtazapine temporal relationship use mirtazapine symptom rls patient support potentiating effect domperione mirtazapineassociated rls however physician aware possibility mirtazapine associated rls individual especially receiving concomitant dopamine receptor antagonist;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Antitumor effect, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin in the IgM solid immunocytoma-bearing LOU/M/WSL rat.;Antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin were studied in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats each bearing a transplantable solid IgM immunocytoma. Animals with a tumor (diameter, 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) were treated with iv injections of doxorubicin on 5 consecutive days, followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks (dose range, 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt). Tumor regression was observed with 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg. Complete disappearance of the tumor was induced with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity scored as grade III was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Light microscopic evidence of renal damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, which resulted in albuminuria and very low serum albumin levels. In the group that received 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously. The same experiments were performed with non-tumor-bearing rats, in which no major differences were observed. In conclusion, antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same LOU/M/WSL rat. Albuminuria due to renal damage led to extremely low serum albumin levels, so ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;antitumor effect cardiotoxicity nephrotoxicity doxorubicin igm solid immunocytomabearing loumwsl rat;antitumor activity cardiotoxicity nephrotoxicity induced doxorubicin studied loumwsl inbred rat bearing transplantable solid igm immunocytoma animal tumor diameter treated injection doxorubicin consecutive day followed weekly injection week dose range mgkg body tumor regression observed doxorubicinkg complete disappearance tumor induced doxorubicinkg histologic evidence cardiotoxicity scored grade iii observed dose doxorubicinkg light microscopic evidence renal damage seen dose doxorubicinkg resulted albuminuria low serum albumin level group received doxorubicinkg serum albumin level decreased gliter ascites hydrothorax observed simultaneously experiment performed nontumorbearing rat major difference observed conclusion antitumor activity cardiotoxicity nephrotoxicity studied simultaneously loumwsl rat albuminuria due renal damage led extremely low serum albumin level ascites hydrothorax necessarily consequence observed cardiomyopathy;antitumor effect cardiotoxicity nephrotoxicity doxorubicin igm solid immunocytomabearing loumwsl rat antitumor activity cardiotoxicity nephrotoxicity induced doxorubicin studied loumwsl inbred rat bearing transplantable solid igm immunocytoma animal tumor diameter treated injection doxorubicin consecutive day followed weekly injection week dose range mgkg body tumor regression observed doxorubicinkg complete disappearance tumor induced doxorubicinkg histologic evidence cardiotoxicity scored grade iii observed dose doxorubicinkg light microscopic evidence renal damage seen dose doxorubicinkg resulted albuminuria low serum albumin level group received doxorubicinkg serum albumin level decreased gliter ascites hydrothorax observed simultaneously experiment performed nontumorbearing rat major difference observed conclusion antitumor activity cardiotoxicity nephrotoxicity studied simultaneously loumwsl rat albuminuria due renal damage led extremely low serum albumin level ascites hydrothorax necessarily consequence observed cardiomyopathy;cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Functional link between ataxia-telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene products.;Ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) are recessive genetic disorders with susceptibility to cancer and similar cellular phenotypes . The protein product of the gene responsible for A-T , designated ATM , is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain . The NBS1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the DNA repair proteins Rad50 and Mrel1 . Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1 , induced by ionizing radiation , requires catalytically active ATM . Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation . We have identified two residues of NBS1 , Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage . This response includes S-phase checkpoint activation , formation of the NBS1 / Mrel1 / Rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation . Together , these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell-cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in two genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes . .;neurological|oncological;functional link ataxiatelangiectasia nijmegen breakage syndrome gene product;ataxiatelangiectasia nijmegen breakage syndrome nb recessive genetic disorder susceptibility cancer similar cellular phenotype protein product gene responsible designated atm member family kinase characterized carboxyterminal phosphatidylinositol kinaselike domain nb protein specifically mutated patient nijmegen breakage syndrome form complex dna repair protein rad mrel show phosphorylation nb induced ionizing radiation requires catalytically active atm complex containing atm nb exist vivo untreated cell cell treated ionizing radiation identified two residue nb ser ser phosphorylated vitro atm whose modification vivo essential cellular response dna damage response includes sphase checkpoint activation formation nb mrel rad nuclear focus rescue hypersensitivity ionizing radiation together result demonstrate biochemical link cellcycle checkpoint activated dna damage dna repair two genetic disease overlapping phenotype;functional link ataxiatelangiectasia nijmegen breakage syndrome gene product ataxiatelangiectasia nijmegen breakage syndrome nb recessive genetic disorder susceptibility cancer similar cellular phenotype protein product gene responsible designated atm member family kinase characterized carboxyterminal phosphatidylinositol kinaselike domain nb protein specifically mutated patient nijmegen breakage syndrome form complex dna repair protein rad mrel show phosphorylation nb induced ionizing radiation requires catalytically active atm complex containing atm nb exist vivo untreated cell cell treated ionizing radiation identified two residue nb ser ser phosphorylated vitro atm whose modification vivo essential cellular response dna damage response includes sphase checkpoint activation formation nb mrel rad nuclear focus rescue hypersensitivity ionizing radiation together result demonstrate biochemical link cellcycle checkpoint activated dna damage dna repair two genetic disease overlapping phenotype;neurological|oncological;hepatorenal|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Immunopathology of penicillamine-induced glomerular disease.;Four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with D-penicillamine. Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal. Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3. The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early-acting complement components C1q and C4.

Does supplemental vitamin C increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes?;"BACKGROUND: Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro. These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements. Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of stroke were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01). When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline. CONCLUSION: A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes.";neurological|cardiovascular;supplemental vitamin increase cardiovascular disease risk woman diabetes;background vitamin act potent antioxidant however also prooxidant glycate protein certain circumstance vitro observation led hypothesize high intake vitamin diabetic person might promote atherosclerosis objective objective examine relation vitamin intake mortality cardiovascular disease design studied relation vitamin intake mortality total cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease stroke postmenopausal woman reported diabetic baseline diet assessed foodfrequency questionnaire baseline subject initially free coronary artery disease prospectively followed result adjustment cardiovascular disease risk factor type diabetes medication used duration diabetes intake folate vitamin betacarotene adjusted relative risk total cardiovascular disease mortality trend across quintiles total vitamin intake food supplement adjusted relative risk coronary artery disease trend stroke trend dietary supplemental vitamin analyzed separately supplemental vitamin showed positive association mortality endpoint vitamin intake unrelated mortality cardiovascular disease nondiabetic subject baseline conclusion high vitamin intake supplement associated increased risk cardiovascular disease mortality postmenopausal woman diabetes;supplemental vitamin increase cardiovascular disease risk woman diabetes background vitamin act potent antioxidant however also prooxidant glycate protein certain circumstance vitro observation led hypothesize high intake vitamin diabetic person might promote atherosclerosis objective objective examine relation vitamin intake mortality cardiovascular disease design studied relation vitamin intake mortality total cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease stroke postmenopausal woman reported diabetic baseline diet assessed foodfrequency questionnaire baseline subject initially free coronary artery disease prospectively followed result adjustment cardiovascular disease risk factor type diabetes medication used duration diabetes intake folate vitamin betacarotene adjusted relative risk total cardiovascular disease mortality trend across quintiles total vitamin intake food supplement adjusted relative risk coronary artery disease trend stroke trend dietary supplemental vitamin analyzed separately supplemental vitamin showed positive association mortality endpoint vitamin intake unrelated mortality cardiovascular disease nondiabetic subject baseline conclusion high vitamin intake supplement associated increased risk cardiovascular disease mortality postmenopausal woman diabetes;neurological|cardiovascular;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Carbimazole induced ANCA positive vasculitis.;Anti-thyroid drugs, like carbimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. One should be aware of the side effects of antithyroid medications. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)--associated vasculitis is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of antithyroidmedications. We report a patient with Graves' disease who developed ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis. The episode was characterized by a vasculitic skin rash associated with large joint arthritis, pyrexia and parotiditis but no renal or pulmonary involvement. He was referred to us for neurological evaluation because he had difficulty in getting up from squatting position and was suspected to have myositis. Carbimazole and methimazole have a lower incidence of reported ANCA positive side effects than PUT.

The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog: a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man.;"Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized. There is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied. In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment. A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg/kg cefazedone. All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days). This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia. We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin-induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.";neurological;hematologic effect cefonicid cefazedone dog potential model cephalosporin hematotoxicity man;cephalosporin antibiotic cause variety hematologic disturbance man pathogeneses hematopathology remain poorly characterized need welldefined animal model blood dyscrasia studied four subacute toxicity study intravenous administration cefonicid cefazedone beagle dog caused dosedependent incidence anemia neutropenia thrombocytopenia month treatment nonregenerative anemia compromising cytopenia occurred approximately dog receiving mgkg cefonicid mgkg cefazedone three cytopenia completely reversible following cessation treatment time required recovery erythron approximately month considerably longer granulocyte platelet hour day upon rechallenge either cephalosporin hematologic syndrome reproduced dog tested cefonicid cefazedonetreated dog showed substantially reduced induction period day compared first exposure drug day observation along rapid rate decline red cell mass parameter affected dog suggests hemolytic component complicated red cell production problem multiple toxicologic mechanism contributed cytopenia conclude administration high dos cefonicid cefazedone dog induce hematotoxicity similar cephalosporininduced blood dyscrasia described man thus provides useful model studying mechanism disorder;hematologic effect cefonicid cefazedone dog potential model cephalosporin hematotoxicity man cephalosporin antibiotic cause variety hematologic disturbance man pathogeneses hematopathology remain poorly characterized need welldefined animal model blood dyscrasia studied four subacute toxicity study intravenous administration cefonicid cefazedone beagle dog caused dosedependent incidence anemia neutropenia thrombocytopenia month treatment nonregenerative anemia compromising cytopenia occurred approximately dog receiving mgkg cefonicid mgkg cefazedone three cytopenia completely reversible following cessation treatment time required recovery erythron approximately month considerably longer granulocyte platelet hour day upon rechallenge either cephalosporin hematologic syndrome reproduced dog tested cefonicid cefazedonetreated dog showed substantially reduced induction period day compared first exposure drug day observation along rapid rate decline red cell mass parameter affected dog suggests hemolytic component complicated red cell production problem multiple toxicologic mechanism contributed cytopenia conclude administration high dos cefonicid cefazedone dog induce hematotoxicity similar cephalosporininduced blood dyscrasia described man thus provides useful model studying mechanism disorder;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Bilateral optic neuropathy due to combined ethambutol and isoniazid treatment.;The case of a 40-year-old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with ethambutol and isoniazid is reported.

Susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis in twins: the role of genes, HLA, and the environment.;OBJECTIVE  To determine the relative effects of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) . METHODS  Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database . Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses , and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems . HLA typing for HLA-B27 , HLA-B60 , and HLA-DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers , and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers . Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx , using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS . RESULTS  Six of 8 monozygotic ( MZ ) twin pairs were disease concordant , compared with 4 of 15 B27-positive dizygotic ( DZ ) twin pairs ( 27 % ) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall ( 12 . 5 % ) . Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease-concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins . HLA-B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands , and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co-twin was positive for both B27 and DR1 . Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97 % of the population variance . CONCLUSION  Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined , and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous . HLA-B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS .;neurological;susceptibility ankylosing spondylitis twin role gene hla environment;objective determine relative effect genetic environmental factor susceptibility ankylosing spondylitis method twin identified royal national hospital rheumatic disease database clinical radiographic examination performed establish diagnosis disease severity assessed using combination validated scoring system hla typing hlab hlab hladr performed polymerase chain reaction sequencespecific primer zygosity assessed using microsatellite marker genetic environmental variance component assessed program using data previous study twin result six monozygotic twin pair disease concordant compared bpositive dizygotic twin pair twin pair overall nonsignificant increase similarity regard age disease onset disease severity score assessed noted diseaseconcordant twin compared concordant twin hlab associated disease probands rate disease concordance significantly increased among twin pair cotwin positive additive genetic effect estimated contribute population variance conclusion susceptibility largely genetically determined environmental trigger disease probably ubiquitous hlab account minority overall genetic susceptibility;susceptibility ankylosing spondylitis twin role gene hla environment objective determine relative effect genetic environmental factor susceptibility ankylosing spondylitis method twin identified royal national hospital rheumatic disease database clinical radiographic examination performed establish diagnosis disease severity assessed using combination validated scoring system hla typing hlab hlab hladr performed polymerase chain reaction sequencespecific primer zygosity assessed using microsatellite marker genetic environmental variance component assessed program using data previous study twin result six monozygotic twin pair disease concordant compared bpositive dizygotic twin pair twin pair overall nonsignificant increase similarity regard age disease onset disease severity score assessed noted diseaseconcordant twin compared concordant twin hlab associated disease probands rate disease concordance significantly increased among twin pair cotwin positive additive genetic effect estimated contribute population variance conclusion susceptibility largely genetically determined environmental trigger disease probably ubiquitous hlab account minority overall genetic susceptibility;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Use of propranolol in the treatment of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension.;Five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study. They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused norepinephrine. Treatment with propanolol administered intravenously (1-5 mg) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg. Chronic oral administration of propranolol (40-160 mg/day) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed. In 1 patient, marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdrawn. It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed. Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect, although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time. Hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following propranolol therapy. The studies suggest that propranolol is a useful drug in selected patients with severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension.;cardiovascular;use propranolol treatment idiopathic orthostatic hypotension;five patient idiopathic orthostatic hypotension physiologic biochemical evidence severe autonomic dysfunction included study exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamine plasma renin activity recumbent upright position marked hypersensitivity pressor effect infused norepinephrine treatment propanolol administered intravenously produced increase supine upright blood pressure individual rise ranging mmhg chronic oral administration propranolol mgday also elevated blood pressure individual increase order mmg observed patient marked hypertension induced propranolol drug withdrawn otherwise well tolerated important side effect observed treatment continued individual month persistence pressor effect although appears decrease degree response time hemodynamic measurement patient demonstrated increase total peripheral resistance essentially change cardiac output following propranolol therapy study suggest propranolol useful drug selected patient severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension;use propranolol treatment idiopathic orthostatic hypotension five patient idiopathic orthostatic hypotension physiologic biochemical evidence severe autonomic dysfunction included study exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamine plasma renin activity recumbent upright position marked hypersensitivity pressor effect infused norepinephrine treatment propanolol administered intravenously produced increase supine upright blood pressure individual rise ranging mmhg chronic oral administration propranolol mgday also elevated blood pressure individual increase order mmg observed patient marked hypertension induced propranolol drug withdrawn otherwise well tolerated important side effect observed treatment continued individual month persistence pressor effect although appears decrease degree response time hemodynamic measurement patient demonstrated increase total peripheral resistance essentially change cardiac output following propranolol therapy study suggest propranolol useful drug selected patient severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension;cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Retinoschisin, the X-linked retinoschisis protein, is a secreted photoreceptor protein, and is expressed and released by Weri-Rb1 cells.;X-linked retinoschisis is characterized by microcystic-like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers , leading to visual deterioration in males . Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating . RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein , retinoschisin , which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function . We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin , which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol , but multimers sized > 40 kDa under non-reducing conditions . A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae . We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA ( using in situ hybridization with riboprobes ) and retinoschisin ( using immunohistochemistry ) . The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina . Furthermore , differentiated retinoblastoma cells ( Weri-Rb1 cells ) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin . These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers . Thus , X-linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy . .;neurological;retinoschisin xlinked retinoschisis protein secreted photoreceptor protein expressed released werirb cell;xlinked retinoschisis characterized microcysticlike change macular region schisis within inner retinal layer leading visual deterioration male many missense proteintruncating mutation causative gene identified thought inactivating encodes amino acid protein retinoschisin contains discoidin domain unknown function generated polyclonal antibody peptide unique region within retinoschisin detects protein approximately kda retinal sample reduced dithiothreitol multimers sized kda nonreducing condition screen human tissue antibody reveals retinoschisin retina specific antibody detects protein similar size bovine murine retina investigated expression pattern retina mrna using situ hybridization riboprobes retinoschisin using immunohistochemistry antisense riboprobe detected mrna photoreceptor layer protein product gene present photoreceptors within inner portion retina furthermore differentiated retinoblastoma cell werirb cell found express mrna release retinoschisin result suggest retinoschisin released photoreceptors function within inner retinal layer thus xlinked retinoschisis caused abnormality putative secreted photoreceptor protein first example secreted photoreceptor protein associated retinal dystrophy;retinoschisin xlinked retinoschisis protein secreted photoreceptor protein expressed released werirb cell xlinked retinoschisis characterized microcysticlike change macular region schisis within inner retinal layer leading visual deterioration male many missense proteintruncating mutation causative gene identified thought inactivating encodes amino acid protein retinoschisin contains discoidin domain unknown function generated polyclonal antibody peptide unique region within retinoschisin detects protein approximately kda retinal sample reduced dithiothreitol multimers sized kda nonreducing condition screen human tissue antibody reveals retinoschisin retina specific antibody detects protein similar size bovine murine retina investigated expression pattern retina mrna using situ hybridization riboprobes retinoschisin using immunohistochemistry antisense riboprobe detected mrna photoreceptor layer protein product gene present photoreceptors within inner portion retina furthermore differentiated retinoblastoma cell werirb cell found express mrna release retinoschisin result suggest retinoschisin released photoreceptors function within inner retinal layer thus xlinked retinoschisis caused abnormality putative secreted photoreceptor protein first example secreted photoreceptor protein associated retinal dystrophy;neurological;none;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Gene therapy for phenylketonuria.;Classical phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . Limitations of the current dietary treatment for PKU have led to the development of potential treatments based on somatic gene transfer . Three different vector systems have been examined . Vectors derived from a recombinant retrovirus or a DNA / protein complex can efficiently transduce the PAH cDNA into PAH-deficient hepatocytes in vitro , but the application of these vector systems is presently limited by their low transduction efficiency in vivo . In contrast , a vector derived from a recombinant adenovirus can restore 10 % -80 % of normal hepatic PAH activity into PAH-deficient mice , which completely normalizes serum phenylalanine levels . This treatment is transient and cannot be effectively re-administered due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the recombinant adenoviral vector . However , these findings suggest that PKU can be completely corrected by somatic gene therapy , and provide some direction for the future development of adenoviral vectors . .;neurological|hepatorenal;gene therapy phenylketonuria;classical phenylketonuria pku autosomal recessive disorder caused deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase pah limitation current dietary treatment pku led development potential treatment based somatic gene transfer three different vector system examined vector derived recombinant retrovirus dna protein complex efficiently transduce pah cdna pahdeficient hepatocytes vitro application vector system presently limited low transduction efficiency vivo contrast vector derived recombinant adenovirus restore normal hepatic pah activity pahdeficient mouse completely normalizes serum phenylalanine level treatment transient effectively readministered due presence neutralizing antibody directed recombinant adenoviral vector however finding suggest pku completely corrected somatic gene therapy provide direction future development adenoviral vector;gene therapy phenylketonuria classical phenylketonuria pku autosomal recessive disorder caused deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase pah limitation current dietary treatment pku led development potential treatment based somatic gene transfer three different vector system examined vector derived recombinant retrovirus dna protein complex efficiently transduce pah cdna pahdeficient hepatocytes vitro application vector system presently limited low transduction efficiency vivo contrast vector derived recombinant adenovirus restore normal hepatic pah activity pahdeficient mouse completely normalizes serum phenylalanine level treatment transient effectively readministered due presence neutralizing antibody directed recombinant adenoviral vector however finding suggest pku completely corrected somatic gene therapy provide direction future development adenoviral vector;neurological|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy with iodine-125-metaiodobenzylguanidine.;Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an analog of norepinephrine (NE), serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function. Using a rat model of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy. The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week). There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group. Myocardial accumulation of [125I]MIBG 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less. However, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05). In the 5-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). In the 8-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). Thus, MIBG accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose-dependent manner. The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment (scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration) indicates that MIBG scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.;neurological|cardiovascular;detection abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity adriamycininduced cardiomyopathy iodinemetaiodobenzylguanidine;radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine mibg analog norepinephrine serf index adrenergic neuron integrity function using rat model adriamycininduced cardiomyopathy tested hypothesis abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear exacerbated dosedependently adriamycin cardiomyopathy degree vacuolar degeneration myocardial cell analyzed relation duration adriamycin treatment mgkg week abnormality isolated degeneration treatment group isolated scattered degeneration half group frequent scattered degeneration group scattered focal degeneration group extensive degeneration group myocardial accumulation imibg intravenous injection differ control group treated less however group slightly lower accumulation right ventricular wall control significantly lower accumulation left ventricular wall control less group mibg accumulation right left ventricular wall control respectively less group mibg accumulation right left ventricular wall control respectively less thus mibg accumulation myocardium decreased adriamycin dosedependent manner appearance impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity presence slight myocardial impairment scattered focal vacuolar degeneration indicates mibg scintigraphy may useful method detection adriamycininduced cardiomyopathy;detection abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity adriamycininduced cardiomyopathy iodinemetaiodobenzylguanidine radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine mibg analog norepinephrine serf index adrenergic neuron integrity function using rat model adriamycininduced cardiomyopathy tested hypothesis abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear exacerbated dosedependently adriamycin cardiomyopathy degree vacuolar degeneration myocardial cell analyzed relation duration adriamycin treatment mgkg week abnormality isolated degeneration treatment group isolated scattered degeneration half group frequent scattered degeneration group scattered focal degeneration group extensive degeneration group myocardial accumulation imibg intravenous injection differ control group treated less however group slightly lower accumulation right ventricular wall control significantly lower accumulation left ventricular wall control less group mibg accumulation right left ventricular wall control respectively less group mibg accumulation right left ventricular wall control respectively less thus mibg accumulation myocardium decreased adriamycin dosedependent manner appearance impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity presence slight myocardial impairment scattered focal vacuolar degeneration indicates mibg scintigraphy may useful method detection adriamycininduced cardiomyopathy;neurological|cardiovascular;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Alstrom syndrome: further evidence for linkage to human chromosome 2p13.;Alstrom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal degeneration , sensorineural hearing loss , early-onset obesity , and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus . The gene for Alstrom syndrome ( ALMS1 ) has been previously localized to human chromosome 2p13 by homozygosity mapping in two distinct isolated populations - French Acadian and North African . Pair-wise analyses resulted in maximum lod ( logarithm of the odds ratio ) scores of 3 . 84 and 2 . 9 , respectively . To confirm these findings , a large linkage study was performed in twelve additional families segregating for Alstrom syndrome . A maximum two-point lod score of 7 . 13 ( theta = 0 . 00 ) for marker D2S2110 and a maximum cumulative multipoint lod score of 9 . 16 for marker D2S2110 were observed , further supporting linkage to chromosome 2p13 . No evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed in these families . Meiotic recombination events have localized the critical region containing ALMS1 to a 6 . 1-cM interval flanked by markers D2S327 and D2S286 .

Chloroacetaldehyde as a sulfhydryl reagent: the role of critical thiol groups in ifosfamide nephropathy.;Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (IFO) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti-tumor therapy with IFO. Depletion of sulfhydryl (SH) groups has been reported from cell culture, animal and clinical studies. In this work the effect of CAA on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture (hRPTEC) was investigated. Toxicity of CAA was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity. Free thiols were measured by the method of Ellman. CAA reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein, induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers. CAA but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase-3, caspase-8 and cathepsin B. Caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA. In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage. The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate. Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells. Thus, CAA directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC. This effect can be reduced by acidification. Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients.;hepatorenal|oncological;chloroacetaldehyde sulfhydryl reagent role critical thiol group ifosfamide nephropathy;chloroacetaldehyde caa metabolite alkylating agent ifosfamide ifo putatively responsible renal damage following antitumor therapy ifo depletion sulfhydryl group reported cell culture animal clinical study work effect caa human proximal tubule cell primary culture hrptec investigated toxicity caa determined protein content cell number ldh release trypan blue exclusion assay caspase activity free thiols measured method ellman caa reduced hrptec cell number protein induced loss free intracellular thiols increase necrosis marker caa acrolein inhibited cysteine protease caspase caspase cathepsin caspase activation cisplatin inhibited caa cell stained fluorescent dye targeting lysosome caa induced increase lysosomal size lysosomal leakage effect caa cysteine protease activity thiols could reproduced cell lysate acidification slowed reaction caa thiol donor could also attenuate effect caa necrosis marker thiol depletion cysteine protease inhibition living cell thus caa directly reacts cellular protein nonprotein thiols mediating toxicity hrptec effect reduced acidification therefore urinary acidification could option prevent ifo nephropathy patient;chloroacetaldehyde sulfhydryl reagent role critical thiol group ifosfamide nephropathy chloroacetaldehyde caa metabolite alkylating agent ifosfamide ifo putatively responsible renal damage following antitumor therapy ifo depletion sulfhydryl group reported cell culture animal clinical study work effect caa human proximal tubule cell primary culture hrptec investigated toxicity caa determined protein content cell number ldh release trypan blue exclusion assay caspase activity free thiols measured method ellman caa reduced hrptec cell number protein induced loss free intracellular thiols increase necrosis marker caa acrolein inhibited cysteine protease caspase caspase cathepsin caspase activation cisplatin inhibited caa cell stained fluorescent dye targeting lysosome caa induced increase lysosomal size lysosomal leakage effect caa cysteine protease activity thiols could reproduced cell lysate acidification slowed reaction caa thiol donor could also attenuate effect caa necrosis marker thiol depletion cysteine protease inhibition living cell thus caa directly reacts cellular protein nonprotein thiols mediating toxicity hrptec effect reduced acidification therefore urinary acidification could option prevent ifo nephropathy patient;hepatorenal|oncological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBSAG) seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.;"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Cancer patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation. In this study, cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic HBV infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine. The objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation, and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT. Two groups were compared in this study. The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment. The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine. They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT. The outcomes were compared for both groups. Of our control group (n= 50), 21 patients (42%) were established hepatitis. Twelve (24%) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis. In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient (2.7%) of 37 patients (p < 0.006). Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group; 154:64 (p < 0.32). Our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy. Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate nucleoside or nucleotide analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during CT and the optimal duration of administration after completion of CT.";hepatorenal|oncological;lamivudine prevention hepatitis virus reactivation hepatitisb surface antigen hbsag seropositive cancer patient undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy;hepatitis virus hbv one major cause chronic liver disease worldwide cancer patient chronic carrier hbv higher hepatic complication rate receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy mainly attributed hbv reactivation study cancer patient solid hematological malignancy chronic hbv infection received antiviral agent lamivudine prior compared historical control group receive lamivudine objective assess efficacy lamivudine reducing incidence hbv reactivation diminishing morbidity mortality two group compared study prophylactic lamivudin group consisted patient received prophylactic lamivudine treatment historical control consisted consecutive patient underwent without prophylactic lamivudine followed week outcome compared group control group patient established hepatitis twelve evaluated severe hepatitis prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis observed patient patient comparison mean alt value revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase alt value control group prophylactic lamivudine group study suggests prophylactic lamivudine significantly decrease incidence hbv reactivation overall morbidity cancer patient immunosuppressive therapy study needed determine appropriate nucleoside nucleotide analogue antiviral prophylaxis optimal duration administration completion;lamivudine prevention hepatitis virus reactivation hepatitisb surface antigen hbsag seropositive cancer patient undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy hepatitis virus hbv one major cause chronic liver disease worldwide cancer patient chronic carrier hbv higher hepatic complication rate receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy mainly attributed hbv reactivation study cancer patient solid hematological malignancy chronic hbv infection received antiviral agent lamivudine prior compared historical control group receive lamivudine objective assess efficacy lamivudine reducing incidence hbv reactivation diminishing morbidity mortality two group compared study prophylactic lamivudin group consisted patient received prophylactic lamivudine treatment historical control consisted consecutive patient underwent without prophylactic lamivudine followed week outcome compared group control group patient established hepatitis twelve evaluated severe hepatitis prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis observed patient patient comparison mean alt value revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase alt value control group prophylactic lamivudine group study suggests prophylactic lamivudine significantly decrease incidence hbv reactivation overall morbidity cancer patient immunosuppressive therapy study needed determine appropriate nucleoside nucleotide analogue antiviral prophylaxis optimal duration administration completion;hepatorenal|oncological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Identification of a novel nonsense mutation and a missense substitution in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene in two Spanish kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.;Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II ( AVP-NPII ) gene on chromosome 20p13 . In this study , we analyzed two families with FNDI using direct automated fluorescent , solid phase , single-stranded DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified AVP-NPII DNA . In one of the families , affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene , consisting in a G to T transition at nucleotide 2101 , which produces a stop signal in codon 82 ( Glu ) of NPII . The premature termination eliminates part of the C-terminal domain of NPII , including a cysteine residue in position 85 , which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone . In the second family , a G279A substitution at position -1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals . This missense mutation , which replaces Ala with Thr , is frequent among FNDI patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases . .;neurological;identification novel nonsense mutation missense substitution vasopressinneurophysin gene two spanish kindred familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus;familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus fndi autosomal dominant disease caused deficiency antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin avp encoded avpneurophysin avpnpii gene chromosome study analyzed two family fndi using direct automated fluorescent solid phase singlestranded dna sequencing pcramplified avpnpii dna one family affected individual presented novel nonsense mutation exon gene consisting transition nucleotide produce stop signal codon glu npii premature termination eliminates part cterminal domain npii including cysteine residue position could involved correct folding prohormone second family substitution position signal peptide observed affected individual missense mutation replaces ala thr frequent among fndi patient thought reduce efficiency cleavage signal peptidase;identification novel nonsense mutation missense substitution vasopressinneurophysin gene two spanish kindred familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus fndi autosomal dominant disease caused deficiency antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin avp encoded avpneurophysin avpnpii gene chromosome study analyzed two family fndi using direct automated fluorescent solid phase singlestranded dna sequencing pcramplified avpnpii dna one family affected individual presented novel nonsense mutation exon gene consisting transition nucleotide produce stop signal codon glu npii premature termination eliminates part cterminal domain npii including cysteine residue position could involved correct folding prohormone second family substitution position signal peptide observed affected individual missense mutation replaces ala thr frequent among fndi patient thought reduce efficiency cleavage signal peptidase;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose.;"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure. The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure. METHODOLOGY: Serum levels of sFas (soluble Fas) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure (median, 26.8 U/mL; range, 6.9-52.7 U/mL) compared to the normal controls (median, 8.6 U/mL; range, 6.5-12.0 U/mL, P < 0.0001). Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose (median, 28.7 U/mL; range, 12.8-52.7 U/mL, n = 17) than those due to non-A to E hepatitis (median, 12.5 U/mL; range, 6.9-46.0 U/mL, n = 7, P < 0.01). There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients. A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.613, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.";neurological|hepatorenal|oncological;increased serum soluble fa patient acute liver failure due paracetamol overdose;backgroundaims experimental study suggested apoptosis via fasfas ligand signaling system may play important role development acute liver failure aim study investigate soluble form fa patient acute liver failure methodology serum level sfas soluble fa measured elisa patient acute liver failure normal control subject serum level tumor necrosis factoralpha interferongamma also determined elisa result serum sfas significantly increased patient acute liver failure median uml range uml compared normal control median uml range uml level significantly greater patient acute liver failure due paracetamol overdose median uml range uml due nona hepatitis median uml range uml relationship sfas eventual outcome patient significant correlation observed serum sfas level aspartate aminotransferase conclusion increased concentration sfas serum patient acute liver failure may reflect activation fasmediated apoptosis liver together increased tumor necrosis factoralpha may important factor liver cell loss;increased serum soluble fa patient acute liver failure due paracetamol overdose backgroundaims experimental study suggested apoptosis via fasfas ligand signaling system may play important role development acute liver failure aim study investigate soluble form fa patient acute liver failure methodology serum level sfas soluble fa measured elisa patient acute liver failure normal control subject serum level tumor necrosis factoralpha interferongamma also determined elisa result serum sfas significantly increased patient acute liver failure median uml range uml compared normal control median uml range uml level significantly greater patient acute liver failure due paracetamol overdose median uml range uml due nona hepatitis median uml range uml relationship sfas eventual outcome patient significant correlation observed serum sfas level aspartate aminotransferase conclusion increased concentration sfas serum patient acute liver failure may reflect activation fasmediated apoptosis liver together increased tumor necrosis factoralpha may important factor liver cell loss;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN), an expressed gene in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region.;Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is associated with paternally derived chromosomal deletions in region 15q11-13 or with maternal disomy for chromosome 15 . Therefore , loss of the expressed paternal alleles of maternally imprinted genes must be responsible for the PWS phenotype . We have mapped the gene encoding the small nuclear RNA associated polypeptide SmN ( SNRPN ) to human chromosome 15q12 and a processed pseudogene SNRPNP1 to chromosome region 6pter-p21 . Furthermore , SNRPN was mapped to the minimal deletion interval that is critical for PWS . The fact that the mouse Snrpn gene is maternally imprinted in brain suggests that loss of the paternally derived SNRPN allele may be involved in the PWS phenotype . .;neurological;small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide snrpn expressed gene praderwilli syndrome critical region;praderwilli syndrome pws associated paternally derived chromosomal deletion region maternal disomy chromosome therefore loss expressed paternal allele maternally imprinted gene must responsible pws phenotype mapped gene encoding small nuclear rna associated polypeptide smn snrpn human chromosome processed pseudogene snrpnp chromosome region pterp furthermore snrpn mapped minimal deletion interval critical pws fact mouse snrpn gene maternally imprinted brain suggests loss paternally derived snrpn allele may involved pws phenotype;small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide snrpn expressed gene praderwilli syndrome critical region praderwilli syndrome pws associated paternally derived chromosomal deletion region maternal disomy chromosome therefore loss expressed paternal allele maternally imprinted gene must responsible pws phenotype mapped gene encoding small nuclear rna associated polypeptide smn snrpn human chromosome processed pseudogene snrpnp chromosome region pterp furthermore snrpn mapped minimal deletion interval critical pws fact mouse snrpn gene maternally imprinted brain suggests loss paternally derived snrpn allele may involved pws phenotype;neurological;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Norrie disease gene: characterization of deletions and possible function.;"Positional cloning experiments have resulted recently in the isolation of a candidate gene for Norrie disease ( pseudoglioma ; NDP ) , a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder . Here we report the isolation and analysis of human genomic DNA clones encompassing the NDP gene . The gene spans 28 kb and consists of 3 exons , the first of which is entirely contained within the 5 untranslated region . Detailed analysis of genomic deletions in Norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous , both in size and in position . By PCR analysis , we found that expression of the NDP gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain . An extensive DNA and protein sequence comparison between the human NDP gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation . We propose that NDP is a molecule related in function to these genes and may be involved in a pathway that regulates neural cell differentiation and proliferation . .";neurological;norrie disease gene characterization deletion possible function;positional cloning experiment resulted recently isolation candidate gene norrie disease pseudoglioma ndp severe xlinked neurodevelopmental disorder report isolation analysis human genomic dna clone encompassing ndp gene gene span consists exon first entirely contained within untranslated region detailed analysis genomic deletion norrie patient show heterogeneous size position pcr analysis found expression ndp gene confined eye brain extensive dna protein sequence comparison human ndp gene related gene database revealed homology cysteinerich proteinbinding domain immediateearly gene implicated regulation cell proliferation propose ndp molecule related function gene may involved pathway regulates neural cell differentiation proliferation;norrie disease gene characterization deletion possible function positional cloning experiment resulted recently isolation candidate gene norrie disease pseudoglioma ndp severe xlinked neurodevelopmental disorder report isolation analysis human genomic dna clone encompassing ndp gene gene span consists exon first entirely contained within untranslated region detailed analysis genomic deletion norrie patient show heterogeneous size position pcr analysis found expression ndp gene confined eye brain extensive dna protein sequence comparison human ndp gene related gene database revealed homology cysteinerich proteinbinding domain immediateearly gene implicated regulation cell proliferation propose ndp molecule related function gene may involved pathway regulates neural cell differentiation proliferation;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
ATM germline mutations in classical ataxia-telangiectasia patients in the Dutch population.;Germline mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) . In our study , we have determined the ATM mutation spectrum in 19 classical A-T patients , including some immigrant populations , as well as 12 of Dutch ethnic origin . Both the protein truncation test ( PTT ) and the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting ( REF ) method were used and compared for their detection efficiency , identifying 76 % and 60 % of the mutations , respectively . Most patients were found to be compound heterozygote . Seventeen mutations were distinct , of which 10 were not reported previously . Mutations are small deletions or point mutations frequently affecting splice sites . Moreover , a 16 . 7-kb genomic deletion of the 3 end of the gene , most likely a result of recombination between two LINE elements , was identified . The most frequently found mutation , identified in three unrelated Turkish A-T individuals , was previously described to be a Turkish A-T founder mutation . The presence of a founder mutation among relatively small ethnic population groups in Western Europe could indicate a high carrier frequency in such communities . In patients of Dutch ethnic origin , however , no significant founder effect could be identified . The observed genetic heterogeneity including the relative high percentage of splice-site mutations had no reflection on the phenotype .

Classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene.;Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) , which , in turn , is caused by mutations at the GALT gene . The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and , at the end of 1998 , more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide . The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R , K285N , S135L , and N314D . Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent . Overall , it accounts for 60-70 % of mutant chromosomes , but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations . Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems . Globally , K285N is rarer , but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40 % of mutant chromosomes . It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype . S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans . In vitro expression results are discrepant , but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues . Duarte 1 ( or Los Angeles ) and Duarte 2 ( or Duarte ) variants carry the same amino acid substitution , N314D , even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity . N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles . N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems . However , there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals . It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities . The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia . The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated . .;neurological;classical galactosemia mutation galactosephosphate uridyl transferase galt gene;classical galactosemia caused deficiency activity enzyme galactosephosphate uridyl transferase galt turn caused mutation galt gene disorder exhibit considerable allelic heterogeneity end different base change recorded different population ethnic group country worldwide mutation frequently cited common mutation european population predominantly european descent overall account mutant chromosome significant difference relative frequency individual population individual homoallelic tend severe phenotype keeping virtually complete loss enzyme activity observed vitro expression system globally rarer many european population found mutant chromosome invariably associated severe phenotype found almost exclusively african american vitro expression result discrepant individual carrying appear exhibit galt activity tissue duarte los angeles duarte duarte variant carry amino acid substitution even though associated increased erythrocyte galt activity reduced activity linkage disequilibrium base change differ allele impair galt activity vitro expression system however difference abundance galt protein lymphoblastoid cell line individual unclear whether specific molecular change distinguish allele account different activity considerable genetic heterogeneity documented date undoubtedly contributes phenotypic heterogeneity observed galactosemia additional effect nonallelic variation constitutional factor phenotypic variability remain elucidated;classical galactosemia mutation galactosephosphate uridyl transferase galt gene classical galactosemia caused deficiency activity enzyme galactosephosphate uridyl transferase galt turn caused mutation galt gene disorder exhibit considerable allelic heterogeneity end different base change recorded different population ethnic group country worldwide mutation frequently cited common mutation european population predominantly european descent overall account mutant chromosome significant difference relative frequency individual population individual homoallelic tend severe phenotype keeping virtually complete loss enzyme activity observed vitro expression system globally rarer many european population found mutant chromosome invariably associated severe phenotype found almost exclusively african american vitro expression result discrepant individual carrying appear exhibit galt activity tissue duarte los angeles duarte duarte variant carry amino acid substitution even though associated increased erythrocyte galt activity reduced activity linkage disequilibrium base change differ allele impair galt activity vitro expression system however difference abundance galt protein lymphoblastoid cell line individual unclear whether specific molecular change distinguish allele account different activity considerable genetic heterogeneity documented date undoubtedly contributes phenotypic heterogeneity observed galactosemia additional effect nonallelic variation constitutional factor phenotypic variability remain elucidated;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients.;It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients. Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms. Of those, 13 (26%) developed biliary pathology. Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables. After cessation of the treatment, pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period.

Mutations in the RB1 gene and their effects on transcription.;"Inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene during normal retinal development initiates the formation of a retinoblastoma ( RB ) tumor . To identify the mutations which inactivate RB1 , 21 RB tumors isolated from 19 patients were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction or an RNase protection assay or both . Mutations were identified in 13 of 21 RB tumors ; in 8 tumors , the precise errors in nucleotide sequence were characterized . Each of four germ line mutations involved a small deletion or duplication , while three somatic mutations were point mutations leading to splice alterations and loss of an exon from the mature RB1 mRNA . We were unable to detect expression of the mutant allele in lymphoblasts of three bilaterally affected patients , although the mutation was present in the genomic DNA and transcripts containing the mutations were obvious in the RB tumors in the absence of a normal RB1 allele .

Flumazenil induces seizures and death in mixed cocaine-diazepam intoxications.;STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication. DESIGN: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine IP alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine. Three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg IP. Animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical EEG tracings were recorded. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam. RESULTS: In group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle. This resulted in 100% developing seizures and death. Group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle. Animals became somnolent and none died. Group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. Animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration. In group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously. This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death. Group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. This resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < .01), and death, 100% (P < or = .01), compared with group 4. Group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil. This also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < or = .01), and death, 90% (P < or = .05), compared with group 4.

Phase II study of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.;"BACKGROUND: The activity of the combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma. METHODS: The combination of carboplatin (area under the concentration curve [AUC], 5) and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil; starting dose, 40 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma to determine antitumor activity and toxicity profile. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were assessable for response, and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity. The overall response rate was 38%, the median time to response was 10 weeks, the median duration of response was 26 weeks, and the median survival was 37 weeks. The main toxic effect was myelosuppression, with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients, anemia in 12 patients, thrombocytopenia in 11 patients, and neutropenic fever in 3 patients. Four patients had five infusion-related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin, leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients. Grade > or = 2 nonhematologic toxicity included nausea in 17 patients, emesis in 14 patients, fatigue in 9 patients, mucositis and/or stomatitis in 8 patients, constipation in 6 patients, weight loss in 5 patients, hand-foot syndrome in 2 patients, and skin reactions in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin has modest activity in patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma.";oncological;phase study carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin patient recurrent squamous cell carcinoma cervix;background activity combination carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin tested phase study patient recurrent cervical carcinoma method combination carboplatin area concentration curve auc liposomal doxorubicin doxil starting dose mgm administered intravenously every day patient recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma determine antitumor activity toxicity profile result twentynine patient assessable response patient assessable toxicity overall response rate median time response week median duration response week median survival week main toxic effect myelosuppression grade neutropenia patient anemia patient thrombocytopenia patient neutropenic fever patient four patient five infusionrelated reaction infusion liposomal doxorubicin leading treatment discontinuation three patient grade nonhematologic toxicity included nausea patient emesis patient fatigue patient mucositis andor stomatitis patient constipation patient weight loss patient handfoot syndrome patient skin reaction patient conclusion combination carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin modest activity patient recurrent cervical carcinoma;phase study carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin patient recurrent squamous cell carcinoma cervix background activity combination carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin tested phase study patient recurrent cervical carcinoma method combination carboplatin area concentration curve auc liposomal doxorubicin doxil starting dose mgm administered intravenously every day patient recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma determine antitumor activity toxicity profile result twentynine patient assessable response patient assessable toxicity overall response rate median time response week median duration response week median survival week main toxic effect myelosuppression grade neutropenia patient anemia patient thrombocytopenia patient neutropenic fever patient four patient five infusionrelated reaction infusion liposomal doxorubicin leading treatment discontinuation three patient grade nonhematologic toxicity included nausea patient emesis patient fatigue patient mucositis andor stomatitis patient constipation patient weight loss patient handfoot syndrome patient skin reaction patient conclusion combination carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin modest activity patient recurrent cervical carcinoma;oncological;hepatorenal|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

BRCA1 is secreted and exhibits properties of a granin.;Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast and ovarian cancer . However , the function of the BRCA1 protein has remained elusive . We now show that BRCA1 encodes a 190-kD protein with sequence homology and biochemical analogy to the granin protein family . Interestingly , BRCA2 also includes a motif similar to the granin consensus at the C terminus of the protein . Both BRCA1 and the granins localize to secretory vesicles , are secreted by a regulated pathway , are post-translationally glycosylated and are responsive to hormones . As a regulated secretory protein , BRCA1 appears to function by a mechanism not previously described for tumour suppressor gene products . .;oncological;brca secreted exhibit property granin;germline mutation brca responsible case inherited breast ovarian cancer however function brca protein remained elusive show brca encodes protein sequence homology biochemical analogy granin protein family interestingly brca also includes motif similar granin consensus terminus protein brca granins localize secretory vesicle secreted regulated pathway posttranslationally glycosylated responsive hormone regulated secretory protein brca appears function mechanism previously described tumour suppressor gene product;brca secreted exhibit property granin germline mutation brca responsible case inherited breast ovarian cancer however function brca protein remained elusive show brca encodes protein sequence homology biochemical analogy granin protein family interestingly brca also includes motif similar granin consensus terminus protein brca granins localize secretory vesicle secreted regulated pathway posttranslationally glycosylated responsive hormone regulated secretory protein brca appears function mechanism previously described tumour suppressor gene product;oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Homozygosity mapping in a family with microcephaly, mental retardation, and short stature to a Cohen syndrome region on 8q21.;3-8q22.1: redefining a clinical entity. A syndrome of microcephaly , progressive postnatal growth deficiency , and mental retardation was observed in two brothers and their cousin from a multiply consanguineous kindred of Lebanese descent . Hypotonia , chorioretinal dystrophy , and myopia were also identified . The severity of the condition varied among the closely related patients . Because of absence of a distinctive facial appearance , the degree of mental retardation , and short stature , the initially considered clinical diagnosis of Cohen syndrome was withdrawn and a novel genetic entity was assumed . Homozygosity mapping in this family assigned the gene to a 26 . 8-cM region on the chromosome band 8q21 . 3 -22 . 1 , between the microsatellites at D8S270 and D8S514 . The maximum two-point LOD score was found for marker at D8S267 ( Zmax = 3 . . 237 at Omax = 0 . 00 ) . Intriguingly enough , the identified gene region overlaps the refined gene region for Cohen syndrome ( COH1 ) [ Kolehmainen et al . , 1997  Euro J Hum Genet 5  206-213 ] .

Effects of a new calcium antagonist, CD-832, on isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis.;Effects of CD-832 on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem. In the presence of coronary artery stenosis, 3-min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion (10 ng/kg/min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram. After the control ISO infusion with stenosis was performed, equihypotensive doses of CD-832 (3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7), nifedipine (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, n = 9) or diltiazem (10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third ISO infusion. Both CD-832 and diltiazem, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion. In contrast to nifedipine, CD-832 (10 micrograms/kg/min) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 +/- 12% to 115 +/- 26% of the control value (P < .01) and ST-segment elevation from 5.6 +/- 1.0 mV to 1.6 +/- 1.3 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. Diltiazem (30 micrograms/kg/min) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 +/- 14% to 63 +/- 18% of the control value (P < .05) and ST-segment elevation from 4.7 +/- 0.7 mV to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. These data show that CD-832 improves myocardial ischemia during ISO infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of CD-832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of CD-832.;neurological|cardiovascular;effect new calcium antagonist isoproterenolinduced myocardial ischemia dog partial coronary stenosis;effect isoproterenol isoinduced myocardial ischemia studied dog partial coronary stenosis left circumflex coronary artery finding compared nifedipine diltiazem presence coronary artery stenosis min period intracoronary iso infusion ngkgmin increased heart rate maximal rate left ventricular pressure rise resulted decrease percentage segmental shortening stsegment elevation epicardial electrocardiogram control iso infusion stenosis performed equihypotensive dos microgramskgmin nifedipine microgramskgmin diltiazem microgramskgmin infused min second third iso infusion diltiazem nifedipine significantly reduced increase heart rate induced iso infusion contrast nifedipine microgramskgmin prevented decrease percentage segmental shortening control value stsegment elevation min iso infusion stenosis diltiazem microgramskgmin also prevented decrease percentage segmental shortening control value stsegment elevation min iso infusion stenosis data show improves myocardial ischemia iso infusion stenosis suggest negative chronotropic property play major role beneficial effect;effect new calcium antagonist isoproterenolinduced myocardial ischemia dog partial coronary stenosis effect isoproterenol isoinduced myocardial ischemia studied dog partial coronary stenosis left circumflex coronary artery finding compared nifedipine diltiazem presence coronary artery stenosis min period intracoronary iso infusion ngkgmin increased heart rate maximal rate left ventricular pressure rise resulted decrease percentage segmental shortening stsegment elevation epicardial electrocardiogram control iso infusion stenosis performed equihypotensive dos microgramskgmin nifedipine microgramskgmin diltiazem microgramskgmin infused min second third iso infusion diltiazem nifedipine significantly reduced increase heart rate induced iso infusion contrast nifedipine microgramskgmin prevented decrease percentage segmental shortening control value stsegment elevation min iso infusion stenosis diltiazem microgramskgmin also prevented decrease percentage segmental shortening control value stsegment elevation min iso infusion stenosis data show improves myocardial ischemia iso infusion stenosis suggest negative chronotropic property play major role beneficial effect;neurological|cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin-induced heart failure.;Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by oxidant-mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic. Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX. PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1-/- mice received a single injection of DOX (25 mg/kg i.p). Five days after DOX administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP-1+/+ mice, but only to a smaller extent in PARP-1-/- ones. Similar experiments were conducted in BALB/c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle. Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals. In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the DOX-induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart. Thus, PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of DOX. PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the DOX treatment.;cardiovascular|oncological;activation polyadpribose polymerase contributes development doxorubicininduced heart failure;activation nuclear enzyme polyadpribose polymerase parp oxidantmediated dna damage important pathway cell dysfunction tissue injury condition associated oxidative stress increased oxidative stress major factor implicated cardiotoxicity doxorubicin dox widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic thus hypothesized activation parp may contribute doxinduced cardiotoxicity using dual approach parp suppression genetic deletion pharmacological inhibition phenanthridinone parp inhibitor demonstrate role parp development cardiac dysfunction induced dox parp parp mouse received single injection dox mgkg five day dox administration left ventricular performance significantly depressed parp mouse smaller extent parp one similar experiment conducted balbc mouse treated vehicle treatment significantly improved cardiac dysfunction increased survival animal addition significantly reduced doxinduced increase serum lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase activity metalloproteinase activation heart thus parp activation contributes cardiotoxicity dox parp inhibitor may exert protective effect development severe cardiac complication associated dox treatment;activation polyadpribose polymerase contributes development doxorubicininduced heart failure activation nuclear enzyme polyadpribose polymerase parp oxidantmediated dna damage important pathway cell dysfunction tissue injury condition associated oxidative stress increased oxidative stress major factor implicated cardiotoxicity doxorubicin dox widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic thus hypothesized activation parp may contribute doxinduced cardiotoxicity using dual approach parp suppression genetic deletion pharmacological inhibition phenanthridinone parp inhibitor demonstrate role parp development cardiac dysfunction induced dox parp parp mouse received single injection dox mgkg five day dox administration left ventricular performance significantly depressed parp mouse smaller extent parp one similar experiment conducted balbc mouse treated vehicle treatment significantly improved cardiac dysfunction increased survival animal addition significantly reduced doxinduced increase serum lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase activity metalloproteinase activation heart thus parp activation contributes cardiotoxicity dox parp inhibitor may exert protective effect development severe cardiac complication associated dox treatment;cardiovascular|oncological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Canavan disease: mutations among Jewish and non-Jewish patients.;Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase ( ASPA ) . Sixty-four probands were analyzed for mutations in the ASPA gene . Three point mutations--693C-- > A , 854A-- > C , and 914C-- > A--were identified in the coding sequence . The 693C-- > A and 914C-- > A base changes , resulting in nonsense tyr231-- > ter and missense ala305-- > glu mutations , respectively , lead to complete loss of ASPA activity in in vitro expression studies . The 854A-- > C transversion converted glu to ala in codon 285 . The glu285-- > ala mutant ASPA has 2 . 5 % of the activity expressed by the wild-type enzyme . A fourth mutation , 433 --2 ( A-- > G ) transition , was identified at the splice-acceptor site in intron 2 . The splice-site mutation would lead to skipping of exon 3 , accompanied by a frameshift , and thus would produce aberrant ASPA . Of the 128 unrelated Canavan chromosomes analyzed , 88 were from probands of Ashkenazi Jewish descent . The glu285-- > ala mutation was predominant ( 82 . 9 % ) in this population , followed by the tyr231-- > ter ( 14 . 8 % ) and 433 --2 ( A-- > G ) ( 1 . 1 % ) mutations . The three mutations account for 98 . 8 % of the Canavan chromosomes of Ashkenazi Jewish origin . The ala305-- > glu mutation was found exclusively in non-Jewish probands of European descent and constituted 60 % of the 40 mutant chromosomes . Predominant occurrence of certain mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease would suggest a founding-father effect in propagation of these mutant chromosomes;neurological;canavan disease mutation among jewish nonjewish patient;canavan disease autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused deficiency aspartoacylase aspa sixtyfour probands analyzed mutation aspa gene three point mutationsc awere identified coding sequence base change resulting nonsense tyr ter missense ala glu mutation respectively lead complete loss aspa activity vitro expression study transversion converted glu ala codon glu ala mutant aspa activity expressed wildtype enzyme fourth mutation transition identified spliceacceptor site intron splicesite mutation would lead skipping exon accompanied frameshift thus would produce aberrant aspa unrelated canavan chromosome analyzed probands ashkenazi jewish descent glu ala mutation predominant population followed tyr ter mutation three mutation account canavan chromosome ashkenazi jewish origin ala glu mutation found exclusively nonjewish probands european descent constituted mutant chromosome predominant occurrence certain mutation among ashkenazi jewish nonjewish patient canavan disease would suggest foundingfather effect propagation mutant chromosome;canavan disease mutation among jewish nonjewish patient canavan disease autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused deficiency aspartoacylase aspa sixtyfour probands analyzed mutation aspa gene three point mutationsc awere identified coding sequence base change resulting nonsense tyr ter missense ala glu mutation respectively lead complete loss aspa activity vitro expression study transversion converted glu ala codon glu ala mutant aspa activity expressed wildtype enzyme fourth mutation transition identified spliceacceptor site intron splicesite mutation would lead skipping exon accompanied frameshift thus would produce aberrant aspa unrelated canavan chromosome analyzed probands ashkenazi jewish descent glu ala mutation predominant population followed tyr ter mutation three mutation account canavan chromosome ashkenazi jewish origin ala glu mutation found exclusively nonjewish probands european descent constituted mutant chromosome predominant occurrence certain mutation among ashkenazi jewish nonjewish patient canavan disease would suggest foundingfather effect propagation mutant chromosome;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation.;BACKGROUND: Unfractionated heparin sodium (UFH) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to UFH (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level. HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/L, respectively. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)/L on POD 9, respectively. The heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients. The percentage of HIT antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14. None of the subjects/patients developed UFH-related HIT. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the occurrence of HIT after liver transplantation was uncommon.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;heparininduced thrombocytopenia liver transplantation;background unfractionated heparin sodium ufh lowmolecular weight heparin lmwh used anticoagulant protocol several institution prevent thrombosis liver transplantation heparininduced thrombocytopenia hit adverse immunemediated reaction heparin resulting platelet count decrease frequency hit liver transplantation platelet factor heparinreactive antibody hit antibody positivity liver transplantation patient however unknown patient method men woman underwent living donor liver transplantation started lmwh iukgh postoperative day pod switching ufh pod dose ufh changed according activated clotting time level hit antibody level measured day surgery pod platelet count measured daily week result average platelet count preoperatively pod respectively two patient developed hepatic artery thrombosis pod respectively although hit antibodynegative platelet count stable patient platelet count decreased suddenly pod pod pod pod respectively heparininduced platelet aggregation test negative patient percentage hit antibodypositive patient preoperatively pod pod none subjectspatients developed ufhrelated hit conclusion series occurrence hit liver transplantation uncommon;heparininduced thrombocytopenia liver transplantation background unfractionated heparin sodium ufh lowmolecular weight heparin lmwh used anticoagulant protocol several institution prevent thrombosis liver transplantation heparininduced thrombocytopenia hit adverse immunemediated reaction heparin resulting platelet count decrease frequency hit liver transplantation platelet factor heparinreactive antibody hit antibody positivity liver transplantation patient however unknown patient method men woman underwent living donor liver transplantation started lmwh iukgh postoperative day pod switching ufh pod dose ufh changed according activated clotting time level hit antibody level measured day surgery pod platelet count measured daily week result average platelet count preoperatively pod respectively two patient developed hepatic artery thrombosis pod respectively although hit antibodynegative platelet count stable patient platelet count decreased suddenly pod pod pod pod respectively heparininduced platelet aggregation test negative patient percentage hit antibodypositive patient preoperatively pod pod none subjectspatients developed ufhrelated hit conclusion series occurrence hit liver transplantation uncommon;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

D-penicillamine-induced angiopathy in rats. The effect of high dose D-penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel.;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with D-penicillamine (D-pen) 500 mg/kg/day for 10 or 42 days. Pair fed rats served as controls. Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light- and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I-albumin (131I-HSA). TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D-pen-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation. In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. The aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with D-pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate. The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D-pen, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D-pen treatment. These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D-pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.;cardiovascular;dpenicillamineinduced angiopathy rat effect high dose dpenicillamine treatment aortic permeability albumin ultrastructure vessel;male spraguedawley rat treated dpenicillamine dpen mgkgday day pair fed rat served control change aortic morphology examined light transmissionelectron microscopy tem addition endothelial permeability penetration aortic wall albumin studied minute hour injection human serum ialbumin ihsa tem revealed extensive elastolysis arterial wall dpentreated rat consistent inhibitory effect crosslink formation experimental animal excess deposition collagen glycoaminoglycans observed subendothelial medial layer aortic wall together prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cell aortaserumratio radioactive buildup hour injection ihsa reduced animal treated dpen day indicating impeded transmural transport tracer may caused steric exclusion effect abundant hyaluronate endothelial ultrastructure unaffected dpen difference aortic ihsa radioactivity aortaserumratio recorded experimental control group minute tracer injection indicating permeability endothelial barrier albumin remained unaffected dpen treatment observation support hypothesis treatment high dos dpen may induce fibroproliferative response rat aorta possibly inhibitory effect crosslinking collagen elastin;dpenicillamineinduced angiopathy rat effect high dose dpenicillamine treatment aortic permeability albumin ultrastructure vessel male spraguedawley rat treated dpenicillamine dpen mgkgday day pair fed rat served control change aortic morphology examined light transmissionelectron microscopy tem addition endothelial permeability penetration aortic wall albumin studied minute hour injection human serum ialbumin ihsa tem revealed extensive elastolysis arterial wall dpentreated rat consistent inhibitory effect crosslink formation experimental animal excess deposition collagen glycoaminoglycans observed subendothelial medial layer aortic wall together prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cell aortaserumratio radioactive buildup hour injection ihsa reduced animal treated dpen day indicating impeded transmural transport tracer may caused steric exclusion effect abundant hyaluronate endothelial ultrastructure unaffected dpen difference aortic ihsa radioactivity aortaserumratio recorded experimental control group minute tracer injection indicating permeability endothelial barrier albumin remained unaffected dpen treatment observation support hypothesis treatment high dos dpen may induce fibroproliferative response rat aorta possibly inhibitory effect crosslinking collagen elastin;cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Cardiac transplantation: improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol.;The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients. In group I, cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml. In group II, cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine, which was used for the first postoperative week. Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long-term therapy with cyclosporine. Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine. We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiac transplantation improved quality survival modified immunosuppressive protocol;effect renal function two different immunosuppressive protocol evaluated retrospectively two subsequent group heart transplant recipient group cyclosporine given procedure loading dose mgkg continued procedure keep whole blood level ngml group cyclosporine started procedure lower dosage complemented azathioprine used first postoperative week group showed better perioperative renal function determined serum blood urea nitrogen serum creatinine level group also showed significant decrease chronic nephrotoxicity secondary longterm therapy cyclosporine despite improvement late renal function group still show slow rise serum creatinine think even lower dosage cyclosporine cause chronic nephrotoxicity modification immunosuppressive regimen required completely abolish toxic side effect;cardiac transplantation improved quality survival modified immunosuppressive protocol effect renal function two different immunosuppressive protocol evaluated retrospectively two subsequent group heart transplant recipient group cyclosporine given procedure loading dose mgkg continued procedure keep whole blood level ngml group cyclosporine started procedure lower dosage complemented azathioprine used first postoperative week group showed better perioperative renal function determined serum blood urea nitrogen serum creatinine level group also showed significant decrease chronic nephrotoxicity secondary longterm therapy cyclosporine despite improvement late renal function group still show slow rise serum creatinine think even lower dosage cyclosporine cause chronic nephrotoxicity modification immunosuppressive regimen required completely abolish toxic side effect;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Reduced progression of adriamycin nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated by losartan.;BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker, losartan, and its potential in slowing down renal disease progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. METHODS: Six-month-old female SHR were randomly selected in six groups. Two control groups (SH(6), SH(12)) received vehicle. Groups ADR(6), ADR+LOS(6) and ADR(12), and ADR+LOS(12) received ADR (2 mg/kg/b.w. i.v.) twice in a 3-week interval. Group ADR+LOS(6) received losartan (10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages) for 6 weeks and group ADR+LOS(12) for 12 weeks after second injection of ADR. Animals were killed after 6 or 12 weeks, respectively. Haemodynamic measurements were performed on anaesthetized animals, blood and urine samples were taken for biochemical analysis and the left kidney was processed for morphological studies. RESULTS: Short-term losartan treatment, besides antihypertensive effect, improved glomerular filtration rate and ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting in decreased proteinuria. Prolonged treatment with losartan showed further reduction of glomerulosclerosis associated with reduced progression of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus preventing heavy proteinuria and chronic renal failure. Losartan reduced uraemia and increased urea clearance in advanced ADR nephropathy in SHR. Histological examination showed that losartan could prevent tubular atrophy, interstitial infiltration and fibrosis in ADR nephropathy. CONCLUSION: Losartan reduces the rate of progression of ADR-induced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis to end-stage renal disease in SHR.;hepatorenal;reduced progression adriamycin nephropathy spontaneously hypertensive rat treated losartan;background aim study investigate antihypertensive effect angiotensin type receptor blocker losartan potential slowing renal disease progression spontaneously hypertensive rat shr adriamycin adr nephropathy method sixmonthold female shr randomly selected six group two control group received vehicle group adr adrlos adr adrlos received adr mgkgbw twice week interval group adrlos received losartan mgkgbwday gavage week group adrlos week second injection adr animal killed week respectively haemodynamic measurement performed anaesthetized animal blood urine sample taken biochemical analysis left kidney processed morphological study result shortterm losartan treatment besides antihypertensive effect improved glomerular filtration rate ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting decreased proteinuria prolonged treatment losartan showed reduction glomerulosclerosis associated reduced progression tubular atrophy interstitial fibrosis thus preventing heavy proteinuria chronic renal failure losartan reduced uraemia increased urea clearance advanced adr nephropathy shr histological examination showed losartan could prevent tubular atrophy interstitial infiltration fibrosis adr nephropathy conclusion losartan reduces rate progression adrinduced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis endstage renal disease shr;reduced progression adriamycin nephropathy spontaneously hypertensive rat treated losartan background aim study investigate antihypertensive effect angiotensin type receptor blocker losartan potential slowing renal disease progression spontaneously hypertensive rat shr adriamycin adr nephropathy method sixmonthold female shr randomly selected six group two control group received vehicle group adr adrlos adr adrlos received adr mgkgbw twice week interval group adrlos received losartan mgkgbwday gavage week group adrlos week second injection adr animal killed week respectively haemodynamic measurement performed anaesthetized animal blood urine sample taken biochemical analysis left kidney processed morphological study result shortterm losartan treatment besides antihypertensive effect improved glomerular filtration rate ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting decreased proteinuria prolonged treatment losartan showed reduction glomerulosclerosis associated reduced progression tubular atrophy interstitial fibrosis thus preventing heavy proteinuria chronic renal failure losartan reduced uraemia increased urea clearance advanced adr nephropathy shr histological examination showed losartan could prevent tubular atrophy interstitial infiltration fibrosis adr nephropathy conclusion losartan reduces rate progression adrinduced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis endstage renal disease shr;hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Two new arylsulfatase A (ARSA) mutations in a juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) patient.;Fragments of the arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) gene from a patient with juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) were amplified by PCR and ligated into MP13 cloning vectors . Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected , examined for appropriate size inserts , and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA . Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations . One , a point mutation in exon 3 , resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine . Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells . About 5 % of the control expression was observed , suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA . The second mutation , a G-to-A transition , occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron . The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site . Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele , but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected . A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients , members of their families , and normal controls was screened for these mutations . Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample . Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data . No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified . However , combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease . The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme-null mutations , implying that it is completely silent enzymatically . .;neurological|hepatorenal;two new arylsulfatase arsa mutation juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy mld patient;fragment arylsulfatase arsa gene patient juvenileonset metachromatic leukodystrophy mld amplified pcr ligated cloning vector clone hybridizing cdna human arsa selected examined appropriate size insert used prepare singlestranded phage dna examination entire coding intronic sequence revealed two putative diseaserelated mutation one point mutation exon resulted substitution isoleucine serine introduction alteration normal arsa cdna sequence resulted substantial decrease arsa activity transient expression cultured baby hamster kidney cell control expression observed suggesting small residual activity mutated arsa second mutation gtoa transition occurred allele resulted altered splicerecognition sequence exon following intron mutation also resulted loss restriction site apparently normal level mrna generated allele arsa activity immunocrossreactive material could detected collection dna sample known suspected mld patient member family normal control screened mutation four additional individual carrying mutation found among nearly mld patient sample gene segregation original patient family consistent available clinical biochemical data individual homozygous either two mutation identified however combination mld mutation suggest point mutation exon result residual enzyme activity associated lateonset form disease splicesite mutation following exon produce lateinfantile mld combined enzymenull mutation implying completely silent enzymatically;two new arylsulfatase arsa mutation juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy mld patient fragment arylsulfatase arsa gene patient juvenileonset metachromatic leukodystrophy mld amplified pcr ligated cloning vector clone hybridizing cdna human arsa selected examined appropriate size insert used prepare singlestranded phage dna examination entire coding intronic sequence revealed two putative diseaserelated mutation one point mutation exon resulted substitution isoleucine serine introduction alteration normal arsa cdna sequence resulted substantial decrease arsa activity transient expression cultured baby hamster kidney cell control expression observed suggesting small residual activity mutated arsa second mutation gtoa transition occurred allele resulted altered splicerecognition sequence exon following intron mutation also resulted loss restriction site apparently normal level mrna generated allele arsa activity immunocrossreactive material could detected collection dna sample known suspected mld patient member family normal control screened mutation four additional individual carrying mutation found among nearly mld patient sample gene segregation original patient family consistent available clinical biochemical data individual homozygous either two mutation identified however combination mld mutation suggest point mutation exon result residual enzyme activity associated lateonset form disease splicesite mutation following exon produce lateinfantile mld combined enzymenull mutation implying completely silent enzymatically;neurological|hepatorenal;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia.;BACKGROUND AND AIM: Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia. This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon-alpha-2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study. A hemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dL was defined as ribavirin-induced anemia. RESULTS: Ribavirin-induced anemia occurred in 18 (20.5%) patients during treatment. A 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment. The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or =2 g/dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with <2 g/dL decrease (P < 0.01). A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia (P < 0.01). Such factors as sex (female), age (> or =60 years old), and the ribavirin dose by body weight (12 mg/kg or more) were significant by univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Careful administration is necessary in patients > or =60 years old, in female patients, and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg/kg or more. Patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g/dL or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care.;hepatorenal;factor contributing ribavirininduced anemia;background aim interferon ribavirin combination therapy chronic hepatitis produce hemolytic anemia study conducted identify factor contributing ribavirininduced anemia method eightyeight patient chronic hepatitis received interferonalphab dose administered intramuscularly week combination ribavirin administered orally dose participated study hemoglobin concentration gdl defined ribavirininduced anemia result ribavirininduced anemia occurred patient treatment gdl decrease hemoglobin concentration patient anemia observed week start treatment hemoglobin concentration patient gdl decrease week observed significantly lower even week patient gdl decrease significant relationship observed rate reduction hemoglobin concentration week severity anemia factor sex female age year old ribavirin dose body weight mgkg significant univariate analysis conclusion careful administration necessary patient year old female patient patient receiving ribavirin dose mgkg patient experience fall hemoglobin concentration gdl week start treatment monitored particular care;factor contributing ribavirininduced anemia background aim interferon ribavirin combination therapy chronic hepatitis produce hemolytic anemia study conducted identify factor contributing ribavirininduced anemia method eightyeight patient chronic hepatitis received interferonalphab dose administered intramuscularly week combination ribavirin administered orally dose participated study hemoglobin concentration gdl defined ribavirininduced anemia result ribavirininduced anemia occurred patient treatment gdl decrease hemoglobin concentration patient anemia observed week start treatment hemoglobin concentration patient gdl decrease week observed significantly lower even week patient gdl decrease significant relationship observed rate reduction hemoglobin concentration week severity anemia factor sex female age year old ribavirin dose body weight mgkg significant univariate analysis conclusion careful administration necessary patient year old female patient patient receiving ribavirin dose mgkg patient experience fall hemoglobin concentration gdl week start treatment monitored particular care;hepatorenal;hepatorenal|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline.;An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's contracture. After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;unusual toxic reaction axillary block mepivacaine adrenaline;increase blood pressure accompanied atrial fibrillation agitation incomprehensible shout loss consciousness observed elderly asa classification group cardiovascularly medicated male min performance axillary block mepivacaine containing adrenaline correction dupuytrens contracture intravenous administration labetalol metoprolol midazolam patient condition improved min later woke block successful surgery conducted scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation postoperatively patient refused cardioversion treated medically temporal relationship event response treatment suggest rapid systemic absorption mepivacaine adrenaline andor interaction drug patient cardiovascular medication responsible perioperative complication;unusual toxic reaction axillary block mepivacaine adrenaline increase blood pressure accompanied atrial fibrillation agitation incomprehensible shout loss consciousness observed elderly asa classification group cardiovascularly medicated male min performance axillary block mepivacaine containing adrenaline correction dupuytrens contracture intravenous administration labetalol metoprolol midazolam patient condition improved min later woke block successful surgery conducted scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation postoperatively patient refused cardioversion treated medically temporal relationship event response treatment suggest rapid systemic absorption mepivacaine adrenaline andor interaction drug patient cardiovascular medication responsible perioperative complication;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: A major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, with atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: Information regarding major bleeding episodes, strokes, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, relatives, primary physicians, and medical records. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 (range 76-94) were included in the analysis. Total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months). There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal bleeds. The annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%. CONCLUSION: The rate of major hemorrhage was high in this old, frail group, but excluding fatalities, resulted in no long-term sequelae, and the stroke rate on warfarin was low, demonstrating how effective warfarin treatment is.;cardiovascular;people aged atrial fibrillation warfarin rate major hemorrhage stroke patientyears followup;objective determine incidence major hemorrhage stroke people aged older atrial fibrillation adjusteddose warfarin recently admitted hospital design retrospective observational cohort study setting major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospital participant two hundred thirtyfive patient aged older admitted major healthcare network july june atrial fibrillation warfarin enrolled measurement information regarding major bleeding episode stroke warfarin use obtained patient relative primary physician medical record result two hundred twentyeight patient men mean age range included analysis total followup warfarin year mean month major hemorrhage annual rate including lifethreatening five fatal bleeds annual stroke rate initiation warfarin conclusion rate major hemorrhage high old frail group excluding fatality resulted longterm sequela stroke rate warfarin low demonstrating effective warfarin treatment;people aged atrial fibrillation warfarin rate major hemorrhage stroke patientyears followup objective determine incidence major hemorrhage stroke people aged older atrial fibrillation adjusteddose warfarin recently admitted hospital design retrospective observational cohort study setting major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospital participant two hundred thirtyfive patient aged older admitted major healthcare network july june atrial fibrillation warfarin enrolled measurement information regarding major bleeding episode stroke warfarin use obtained patient relative primary physician medical record result two hundred twentyeight patient men mean age range included analysis total followup warfarin year mean month major hemorrhage annual rate including lifethreatening five fatal bleeds annual stroke rate initiation warfarin conclusion rate major hemorrhage high old frail group excluding fatality resulted longterm sequela stroke rate warfarin low demonstrating effective warfarin treatment;cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
A strong candidate for the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1.;A strong candidate for the 17q-linked BRCA1 gene , which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer , has been identified by positional cloning methods . Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles . The mutations include an 11-base pair deletion , a 1-base pair insertion , a stop codon , a missense substitution , and an inferred regulatory mutation .

Sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin-free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.;Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have been available for almost 20 years. Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute nephrotoxicity, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss. Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases. Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus (rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity. The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy. This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.;neurological|hepatorenal;sirolimus mycophenolate mofetil calcineurinfree immunosuppression renal transplant recipient;calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine tacrolimus available almost year although drug highly effective represent mainstay transplant immunosuppression associated acute chronic nephrotoxicity acute nephrotoxicity occurs early period transplantation lead higher rate dialysis chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result graft loss acute chronic nephrotoxicity becoming common use marginal kidney transplantation increase two recently available immunosuppressive agent mycophenolate mofetil sirolimus rapamycin nephrotoxicity use drug combination agent led development new paradigm immunosuppressive therapy paper review result clinical trial investigated new approach immunosuppression renal transplant recipient;sirolimus mycophenolate mofetil calcineurinfree immunosuppression renal transplant recipient calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine tacrolimus available almost year although drug highly effective represent mainstay transplant immunosuppression associated acute chronic nephrotoxicity acute nephrotoxicity occurs early period transplantation lead higher rate dialysis chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result graft loss acute chronic nephrotoxicity becoming common use marginal kidney transplantation increase two recently available immunosuppressive agent mycophenolate mofetil sirolimus rapamycin nephrotoxicity use drug combination agent led development new paradigm immunosuppressive therapy paper review result clinical trial investigated new approach immunosuppression renal transplant recipient;neurological|hepatorenal;hepatorenal|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Neuroprotective action of MPEP, a selective mGluR5 antagonist, in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with a decrease in dopamine outflow and inhibition of hyperthermia in rats.;"The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats. Methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc), administered five times, reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection. A selective antagonist of mGluR5, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP; 5 mg/kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above-mentioned methamphetamine effects. A single MPEP (5 mg/kg ip) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum, as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine (100 microM). Moreover, it transiently diminished the methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc)-induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature. MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations (500 microM) increased extracellular dopamine levels, while lower concentrations (50-100 microM) were devoid of any effect. The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine-induced toxicity. Neuroprotection rendered by MPEP may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5, and with a decrease in hyperthermia.";neurological;neuroprotective action mpep selective mglur antagonist methamphetamineinduced dopaminergic neurotoxicity associated decrease dopamine outflow inhibition hyperthermia rat;aim study examine role metabotropic glutamate receptor mglur toxic action methamphetamine dopaminergic neurones rat methamphetamine mgkg administered five time reduced level dopamine metabolite striatal tissue measured last injection selective antagonist mglur methylphenylethynylpyridine mpep mgkg administered five time immediately methamphetamine injection reversed abovementioned methamphetamine effect single mpep mgkg injection reduced basal extracellular dopamine level striatum well dopamine release stimulated either methamphetamine mgkg intrastriatally administered veratridine microm moreover transiently diminished methamphetamine mgkg scinduced hyperthermia reduced basal body temperature mpep administered striatum high concentration microm increased extracellular dopamine level lower concentration microm devoid effect result study suggest blockade mglur mpep may protect dopaminergic neurones methamphetamineinduced toxicity neuroprotection rendered mpep may associated reduction methamphetamineinduced dopamine efflux striatum due blockade extrastriatal mglur decrease hyperthermia;neuroprotective action mpep selective mglur antagonist methamphetamineinduced dopaminergic neurotoxicity associated decrease dopamine outflow inhibition hyperthermia rat aim study examine role metabotropic glutamate receptor mglur toxic action methamphetamine dopaminergic neurones rat methamphetamine mgkg administered five time reduced level dopamine metabolite striatal tissue measured last injection selective antagonist mglur methylphenylethynylpyridine mpep mgkg administered five time immediately methamphetamine injection reversed abovementioned methamphetamine effect single mpep mgkg injection reduced basal extracellular dopamine level striatum well dopamine release stimulated either methamphetamine mgkg intrastriatally administered veratridine microm moreover transiently diminished methamphetamine mgkg scinduced hyperthermia reduced basal body temperature mpep administered striatum high concentration microm increased extracellular dopamine level lower concentration microm devoid effect result study suggest blockade mglur mpep may protect dopaminergic neurones methamphetamineinduced toxicity neuroprotection rendered mpep may associated reduction methamphetamineinduced dopamine efflux striatum due blockade extrastriatal mglur decrease hyperthermia;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine. A frequency of bradycardia of 50% was noted in the control group, but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs. Bradycardia (defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min-1) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used. It is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg-1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia, in children, if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated.;neurological|cardiovascular;comparison glycopyrrolate atropine prevention bradycardia arrhythmia following repeated dos suxamethonium child;effectiveness administration glycopyrrolate microgram atropine microgram immediately induction anaesthesia prevent arrhythmia bradycardia following repeated dos suxamethonium child studied control group included comparison lower dose range glycopyrrolate atropine frequency bradycardia noted control group significantly different frequency active drug bradycardia defined decrease heart rate less beat min prevented larger dose either active drug used recommended either glycopyrrolate microgram atropine microgram immediately precede induction anaesthesia child repeated administration suxamethonium anticipated;comparison glycopyrrolate atropine prevention bradycardia arrhythmia following repeated dos suxamethonium child effectiveness administration glycopyrrolate microgram atropine microgram immediately induction anaesthesia prevent arrhythmia bradycardia following repeated dos suxamethonium child studied control group included comparison lower dose range glycopyrrolate atropine frequency bradycardia noted control group significantly different frequency active drug bradycardia defined decrease heart rate less beat min prevented larger dose either active drug used recommended either glycopyrrolate microgram atropine microgram immediately precede induction anaesthesia child repeated administration suxamethonium anticipated;neurological|cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels.;"Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics. To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone (n = 12) or haloperidol (n = 7). Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone. Drug-induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%. Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.";neurological;extrapyramidal side effect risperidone haloperidol comparable receptor occupancy level;risperidone antipsychotic drug high affinity dopamine serotonin receptor previous clinical study proposed risperidones pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy negative psychotic symptom decreased propensity extrapyramidal side effect feature shared socalled atypical neuroleptic determine routine risperidone treatment associated unique degree receptor occupancy pattern clinical effect used iibzm spect determine occupancy subject treated routine clinical dos risperidone haloperidol risperidone haloperidol produced occupancy level approximately standard clinical dos significant difference occupancy level obtained haloperidol risperidone druginduced parkinsonism observed subject treated risperidone haloperidol observed occupancy level based observation concluded blockade obtained risperidone occupancy rate appear protect risk extrapyramidal side effect;extrapyramidal side effect risperidone haloperidol comparable receptor occupancy level risperidone antipsychotic drug high affinity dopamine serotonin receptor previous clinical study proposed risperidones pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy negative psychotic symptom decreased propensity extrapyramidal side effect feature shared socalled atypical neuroleptic determine routine risperidone treatment associated unique degree receptor occupancy pattern clinical effect used iibzm spect determine occupancy subject treated routine clinical dos risperidone haloperidol risperidone haloperidol produced occupancy level approximately standard clinical dos significant difference occupancy level obtained haloperidol risperidone druginduced parkinsonism observed subject treated risperidone haloperidol observed occupancy level based observation concluded blockade obtained risperidone occupancy rate appear protect risk extrapyramidal side effect;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

The association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients.;"Because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from January 2004 to December 2010. A convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor movements. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures. A total of 100 (0.9%) patients developed postoperative convulsive seizures. Generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively. The median (IQR [range]) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 (6-12 [1-216]) h and 8 (6-11 [4-18]) h, respectively. Epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients. Independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female sex, redo cardiac surgery, calcification of ascending aorta, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross-clamp and tranexamic acid. When tested in a multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures (OR 14.3, 95% CI 5.5-36.7; p < 0.001). Patients with convulsive seizures had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seizures. Mean (IQR [range]) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 (49-228 [32-481]) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 (22-69 [14-1080]) h in patients without seizures (p < 0.001). Convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery. As tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg(-1), should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures.";neurological|cardiovascular;association tranexamic acid convulsive seizure cardiac surgery multivariate analysis patient;lack contemporary data regarding seizure cardiac surgery undertook retrospective analysis prospectively collected data patient cardiopulmonary bypass used january december convulsive seizure defined transient episode disturbed brain function characterised abnormal involuntary motor movement multivariate regression analysis performed identify independent predictor postoperative seizure total patient developed postoperative convulsive seizure generalised focal seizure identified patient respectively median iqr range time surgery seizure occurred respectively epileptiform finding electroencephalography seen patient independent predictor postoperative seizure included age female sex redo cardiac surgery calcification ascending aorta congestive heart failure deep hypothermic circulatory arrest duration aortic crossclamp tranexamic acid tested multivariate regression analysis tranexamic acid strong independent predictor seizure patient convulsive seizure time higher inhospital mortality rate twice length hospital stay compared patient without convulsive seizure mean iqr range length stay intensive care unit patient convulsive seizure compared patient without seizure convulsive seizure serious postoperative complication cardiac surgery tranexamic acid modifiable factor administration particularly dos exceeding mgkg weighed risk postoperative seizure;association tranexamic acid convulsive seizure cardiac surgery multivariate analysis patient lack contemporary data regarding seizure cardiac surgery undertook retrospective analysis prospectively collected data patient cardiopulmonary bypass used january december convulsive seizure defined transient episode disturbed brain function characterised abnormal involuntary motor movement multivariate regression analysis performed identify independent predictor postoperative seizure total patient developed postoperative convulsive seizure generalised focal seizure identified patient respectively median iqr range time surgery seizure occurred respectively epileptiform finding electroencephalography seen patient independent predictor postoperative seizure included age female sex redo cardiac surgery calcification ascending aorta congestive heart failure deep hypothermic circulatory arrest duration aortic crossclamp tranexamic acid tested multivariate regression analysis tranexamic acid strong independent predictor seizure patient convulsive seizure time higher inhospital mortality rate twice length hospital stay compared patient without convulsive seizure mean iqr range length stay intensive care unit patient convulsive seizure compared patient without seizure convulsive seizure serious postoperative complication cardiac surgery tranexamic acid modifiable factor administration particularly dos exceeding mgkg weighed risk postoperative seizure;neurological|cardiovascular;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Randomized, double-blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne dystrophy.;"There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy. We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05. Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups. Although mazindol-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on IGF-I levels was observed.

Comparison of effects of isotonic sodium chloride with diltiazem in prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy.;"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate infusion and isotonic sodium chloride infusion with diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, in preventing CIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated contrast agent for percutaneous coronary angiography (PCAG), all with creatinine values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL. Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients. The first group of patients was administered isotonic sodium chloride; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, while the third group was administered isotonic sodium chloride before and after the contrast injection. The third group received an additional injection of diltiazem the day before and first 2 days after the contrast injection. All of the patients' plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous contrast material. RESULTS: The basal creatinine levels were similar for all three groups (p > 0.05). Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) on the second day after contrast material was injected (26.6%). The number of patients who developed ARF on the second day after the injection in the first group was five (25%), in the second group was six (30%) and the third group was five (25%) (p > 0.05).

Oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage in adriamycin-induced cardiac mitochondrial injury.;The purpose of the present study was to determine if elevated reactive oxygen (ROS)/nitrogen species (RNS) reported to be present in adriamycin (ADR)-induced cardiotoxicity actually resulted in cardiomyocyte oxidative/nitrative damage, and to quantitatively determine the time course and subcellular localization of these postulated damage products using an in vivo approach. B6C3 mice were treated with a single dose of 20 mg/kg ADR. Ultrastructural damage and levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adducts and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) were analyzed. Quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image techniques showed cardiomyocyte injury as early as 3 hours, with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle. Analysis of 4HNE protein adducts by immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance of 4HNE protein adducts in mitochondria as early as 3 hours, with a peak at 6 hours and subsequent decline at 24 hours. 3NT levels were significantly increased in all subcellular compartments at 6 hours and subsequently declined at 24 hours. Our data showed ADR induced 4HNE-protein adducts in mitochondria at the same time point as when mitochondrial injury initially appeared. These results document for the first time in vivo that mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage. The progressive nature of mitochondrial injury suggests that mitochondria, not other subcellular organelles, are the major site of intracellular injury.;cardiovascular;oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage adriamycininduced cardiac mitochondrial injury;purpose present study determine elevated reactive oxygen rosnitrogen specie rn reported present adriamycin adrinduced cardiotoxicity actually resulted cardiomyocyte oxidativenitrative damage quantitatively determine time course subcellular localization postulated damage product using vivo approach mouse treated single dose mgkg adr ultrastructural damage level hydroxynonenal hneprotein adduct nitrotyrosine analyzed quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image technique showed cardiomyocyte injury early hour mitochondrion extensively progressively injured subcellular organelle analysis hne protein adduct immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance hne protein adduct mitochondrion early hour peak hour subsequent decline hour level significantly increased subcellular compartment hour subsequently declined hour data showed adr induced hneprotein adduct mitochondrion time point mitochondrial injury initially appeared result document first time vivo mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage progressive nature mitochondrial injury suggests mitochondrion subcellular organelle major site intracellular injury;oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage adriamycininduced cardiac mitochondrial injury purpose present study determine elevated reactive oxygen rosnitrogen specie rn reported present adriamycin adrinduced cardiotoxicity actually resulted cardiomyocyte oxidativenitrative damage quantitatively determine time course subcellular localization postulated damage product using vivo approach mouse treated single dose mgkg adr ultrastructural damage level hydroxynonenal hneprotein adduct nitrotyrosine analyzed quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image technique showed cardiomyocyte injury early hour mitochondrion extensively progressively injured subcellular organelle analysis hne protein adduct immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance hne protein adduct mitochondrion early hour peak hour subsequent decline hour level significantly increased subcellular compartment hour subsequently declined hour data showed adr induced hneprotein adduct mitochondrion time point mitochondrial injury initially appeared result document first time vivo mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage progressive nature mitochondrial injury suggests mitochondrion subcellular organelle major site intracellular injury;cardiovascular;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias.;Using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis-, and adrenaline-induced canine ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined. Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis, and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). The concentration for adrenaline-induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias. This pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide, and all three drugs have central nervous system (CNS) stimulant action. Because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;antiarrhythmic plasma concentration cibenzoline canine ventricular arrhythmia;using twostage coronary ligation digitalis adrenalineinduced canine ventricular arrhythmia antiarrhythmic effect cibenzoline examined minimum effective plasma concentration arrhythmia model determined cibenzoline suppressed arrhythmia minimum effective plasma concentration arrhythmia induced coronary ligation coronary ligation digitalis adrenaline mgkg mgkg mgkg mgkg microgramsml respectively mean sdm concentration adrenalineinduced arrhythmia significantly higher type arrhythmia pharmacological profile similar mexiletine tocainide three drug central nervous system cns stimulant action cibenzoline weak hypotensive sinus node depressive effect found orally active given coronary ligation arrhythmia dog clinical usefulness expected;antiarrhythmic plasma concentration cibenzoline canine ventricular arrhythmia using twostage coronary ligation digitalis adrenalineinduced canine ventricular arrhythmia antiarrhythmic effect cibenzoline examined minimum effective plasma concentration arrhythmia model determined cibenzoline suppressed arrhythmia minimum effective plasma concentration arrhythmia induced coronary ligation coronary ligation digitalis adrenaline mgkg mgkg mgkg mgkg microgramsml respectively mean sdm concentration adrenalineinduced arrhythmia significantly higher type arrhythmia pharmacological profile similar mexiletine tocainide three drug central nervous system cns stimulant action cibenzoline weak hypotensive sinus node depressive effect found orally active given coronary ligation arrhythmia dog clinical usefulness expected;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Distribution of emerin and lamins in the heart and implications for Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.;Emerin is a nuclear membrane protein which is missing or defective in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) . It is one member of a family of lamina-associated proteins which includes LAP1 , LAP2 and lamin B receptor ( LBR ) . A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage-displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart . Several mAbs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart , though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly , both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels . A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but , after affinity purification against a pure-emerin band on a western blot , it stained only the nuclear membrane . These results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and , therefore , cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in EDMD are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs . Although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei , it was absent from many non-myocyte cells in the heart . This distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin A , a candidate gene for an autosomal form of EDMD . In contrast , lamin B1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei , showing that lamin B1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina . Lamin B1 is also almost completely absent from skeletal muscle nuclei . In EDMD , the additional absence of lamin B1 from heart and skeletal muscle nuclei which already lack emerin may offer an alternative explanation of why these tissues are particularly affected . .;neurological|cardiovascular;distribution emerin lamins heart implication emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy;emerin nuclear membrane protein missing defective emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy edmd one member family laminaassociated protein includes lap lap lamin receptor lbr panel monoclonal antibody mabs mapped six specific site throughout emerin molecule using phagedisplayed peptide library used localize emerin human rabbit heart several mabs different emerin epitope recognize intercalated disc heart though recognized cardiomyocyte nucleus strongly rim intranuclear spot channel polyclonal rabbit antiserum emerin recognize nuclear membrane intercalated disc affinity purification pureemerin band western blot stained nuclear membrane result would expected immunostaining intercalated disc due product emerin gene therefore cast doubt upon hypothesis cardiac defect edmd caused absence emerin intercalated disc although emerin abundant membrane cardiomyocyte nucleus absent many nonmyocyte cell heart distribution emerin similar lamin candidate gene autosomal form edmd contrast lamin absent cardiomyocyte nucleus showing lamin essential localization emerin nuclear lamina lamin also almost completely absent skeletal muscle nucleus edmd additional absence lamin heart skeletal muscle nucleus already lack emerin may offer alternative explanation tissue particularly affected;distribution emerin lamins heart implication emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy emerin nuclear membrane protein missing defective emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy edmd one member family laminaassociated protein includes lap lap lamin receptor lbr panel monoclonal antibody mabs mapped six specific site throughout emerin molecule using phagedisplayed peptide library used localize emerin human rabbit heart several mabs different emerin epitope recognize intercalated disc heart though recognized cardiomyocyte nucleus strongly rim intranuclear spot channel polyclonal rabbit antiserum emerin recognize nuclear membrane intercalated disc affinity purification pureemerin band western blot stained nuclear membrane result would expected immunostaining intercalated disc due product emerin gene therefore cast doubt upon hypothesis cardiac defect edmd caused absence emerin intercalated disc although emerin abundant membrane cardiomyocyte nucleus absent many nonmyocyte cell heart distribution emerin similar lamin candidate gene autosomal form edmd contrast lamin absent cardiomyocyte nucleus showing lamin essential localization emerin nuclear lamina lamin also almost completely absent skeletal muscle nucleus edmd additional absence lamin heart skeletal muscle nucleus already lack emerin may offer alternative explanation tissue particularly affected;neurological|cardiovascular;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Mice lacking mPGES-1 are resistant to lithium-induced polyuria.;Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of lithium-induced polyuria. However, the involvement of a specific, terminal prostaglandin (PG) isomerase has not been evaluated. The present study was undertaken to assess lithium-induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine. This was associated with elevated renal mPGES-1 protein expression and increased urine PGE(2) excretion. In contrast, mPGES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) RT-PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium-treated +/+ mice. This decrease was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. qRT-PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex. Similarly, the total protein abundance of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment.

An animal model for Norrie disease (ND): gene targeting of the mouse ND gene.;In order to elucidate the cellular and molecular processes which are involved in Norrie disease ( ND ) , we have used gene targeting technology to generate ND mutant mice . The murine homologue of the ND gene was cloned and shown to encode a polypeptide that shares 94 % of the amino acid sequence with its human counterpart . RNA in situ hybridization revealed expression in retina , brain and the olfactory bulb and epithelium of 2 week old mice . Hemizygous mice carrying a replacement mutation in exon 2 of the ND gene developed retrolental structures in the vitreous body and showed an overall disorganization of the retinal ganglion cell layer . The outer plexiform layer disappears occasionally , resulting in a juxtaposed inner and outer nuclear layer . At the same regions , the outer segments of the photoreceptor cell layer are no longer present . These ocular findings are consistent with observations in ND patients and the generated mouse line provides a faithful model for study of early pathogenic events in this severe X-linked recessive neurological disorder . .;neurological;animal model norrie disease gene targeting mouse gene;order elucidate cellular molecular process involved norrie disease used gene targeting technology generate mutant mouse murine homologue gene cloned shown encode polypeptide share amino acid sequence human counterpart rna situ hybridization revealed expression retina brain olfactory bulb epithelium week old mouse hemizygous mouse carrying replacement mutation exon gene developed retrolental structure vitreous body showed overall disorganization retinal ganglion cell layer outer plexiform layer disappears occasionally resulting juxtaposed inner outer nuclear layer region outer segment photoreceptor cell layer longer present ocular finding consistent observation patient generated mouse line provides faithful model study early pathogenic event severe xlinked recessive neurological disorder;animal model norrie disease gene targeting mouse gene order elucidate cellular molecular process involved norrie disease used gene targeting technology generate mutant mouse murine homologue gene cloned shown encode polypeptide share amino acid sequence human counterpart rna situ hybridization revealed expression retina brain olfactory bulb epithelium week old mouse hemizygous mouse carrying replacement mutation exon gene developed retrolental structure vitreous body showed overall disorganization retinal ganglion cell layer outer plexiform layer disappears occasionally resulting juxtaposed inner outer nuclear layer region outer segment photoreceptor cell layer longer present ocular finding consistent observation patient generated mouse line provides faithful model study early pathogenic event severe xlinked recessive neurological disorder;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Safety and side-effects of alprazolam. Controlled study in agoraphobia with panic disorder.;"BACKGROUND: The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects. The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. METHOD: In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo. Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation. Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16. RESULTS: Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily. Compared with placebo subjects, alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of depression, enuresis, disinhibition and aggression; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, irritability, impaired memory, weight loss and ataxia. Side-effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8. Despite this, the drop-out rate was low. CONCLUSIONS: Alprazolam caused side-effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these.";neurological;safety sideeffects alprazolam controlled study agoraphobia panic disorder;background widespread use benzodiazepine led increasing recognition unwanted effect efficacy alprazolam placebo panic disorder agoraphobia sideeffect adverse effect profile drug group measured method london toronto patient met dsmiii criterion panic disorder agoraphobia randomised alprazolam placebo subject drug group also received either exposure relaxation treatment week tapered week result mean alprazolam dose daily compared placebo subject alprazolam patient developed adverse reaction depression enuresis disinhibition aggression sideeffects particularly sedation irritability impaired memory weight loss ataxia sideeffects tended diminish treatment remained significant week despite dropout rate low conclusion alprazolam caused sideeffects adverse effect treatment many patient willing accept;safety sideeffects alprazolam controlled study agoraphobia panic disorder background widespread use benzodiazepine led increasing recognition unwanted effect efficacy alprazolam placebo panic disorder agoraphobia sideeffect adverse effect profile drug group measured method london toronto patient met dsmiii criterion panic disorder agoraphobia randomised alprazolam placebo subject drug group also received either exposure relaxation treatment week tapered week result mean alprazolam dose daily compared placebo subject alprazolam patient developed adverse reaction depression enuresis disinhibition aggression sideeffects particularly sedation irritability impaired memory weight loss ataxia sideeffects tended diminish treatment remained significant week despite dropout rate low conclusion alprazolam caused sideeffects adverse effect treatment many patient willing accept;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Central excitatory actions of flurazepam.;Toxic actions of flurazepam (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats. High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge. As a function of dose, FZP first protected against convulsions and death. At higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.;neurological;central excitatory action flurazepam;toxic action flurazepam fzp studied cat mouse rat high dos caused apparent central excitation clearly seen clonic convulsion superimposed general depression following lethal dose death always associated convulsion comparing relative sensitivity central depression excitation revealed rat least likely convulsion dos first cause loss consciousness cat clearly showed marked central excitatory action sign fzp toxocity cat included excessive salivation extreme apprehensive behavior retching muscle tremor convulsion interaction fzp pentylenetetrazol ptz shown pretreating mouse fzp ptz challenge function dose fzp first protected convulsion death higher dos however convulsion emerged dos fzp lower would alone cause convulsion result may relevant use fzp clinical situation increased neural excitability epilepsy sedativehypnotic drug withdrawal;central excitatory action flurazepam toxic action flurazepam fzp studied cat mouse rat high dos caused apparent central excitation clearly seen clonic convulsion superimposed general depression following lethal dose death always associated convulsion comparing relative sensitivity central depression excitation revealed rat least likely convulsion dos first cause loss consciousness cat clearly showed marked central excitatory action sign fzp toxocity cat included excessive salivation extreme apprehensive behavior retching muscle tremor convulsion interaction fzp pentylenetetrazol ptz shown pretreating mouse fzp ptz challenge function dose fzp first protected convulsion death higher dos however convulsion emerged dos fzp lower would alone cause convulsion result may relevant use fzp clinical situation increased neural excitability epilepsy sedativehypnotic drug withdrawal;neurological;hepatorenal|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Restoration of photoreceptor ultrastructure and function in retinal degeneration slow mice by gene therapy.;The gene Prph2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific membrane glycoprotein , peripherin-2 ( also known as peripherin / rds ) , which is inserted into the rims of photoreceptor outer segment discs in a complex with rom-1 ( ref . 2 ) . The complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs , which are renewed constantly throughout life , and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture . Mutations in Prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies , including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular dystrophy . A common feature of these diseases is the loss of photoreceptor function , also seen in the retinal degeneration slow ( rds or Prph2 Rd2 / Rd2 ) mouse , which is homozygous for a null mutation in Prph2 . It is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments , downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells . The electroretinograms ( ERGs ) of Prph2Rd2 / Rd2 mice have greatly diminished a-wave and b-wave amplitudes , which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months . Subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) encoding a Prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin-2 and rhodopsin , which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments . Moreover , the re-establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction . These studies demonstrate for the first time that a complex ultrastructural cell defect can be corrected both morphologically and functionally by in vivo gene transfer . .;neurological;restoration photoreceptor ultrastructure function retinal degeneration slow mouse gene therapy;gene prph encodes photoreceptorspecific membrane glycoprotein peripherin also known peripherin rds inserted rim photoreceptor outer segment disc complex rom ref complex necessary stabilization disc renewed constantly throughout life contain visual pigment necessary photon capture mutation prph shown result variety photoreceptor dystrophy including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa macular dystrophy common feature disease loss photoreceptor function also seen retinal degeneration slow rds prph mouse homozygous null mutation prph characterized complete failure develop photoreceptor disc outer segment downregulation rhodopsin apoptotic loss photoreceptor cell electroretinogram erg prphrd mouse greatly diminished awave bwave amplitude decline virtually undetectable concentration two month subretinal injection recombinant adenoassociated virus aav encoding prph transgene result stable generation outer segment structure formation new stack disc containing perpherin rhodopsin many case morphologically similar normal outer segment moreover reestablishment structural integrity photoreceptor layer also result electrophysiological correction study demonstrate first time complex ultrastructural cell defect corrected morphologically functionally vivo gene transfer;restoration photoreceptor ultrastructure function retinal degeneration slow mouse gene therapy gene prph encodes photoreceptorspecific membrane glycoprotein peripherin also known peripherin rds inserted rim photoreceptor outer segment disc complex rom ref complex necessary stabilization disc renewed constantly throughout life contain visual pigment necessary photon capture mutation prph shown result variety photoreceptor dystrophy including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa macular dystrophy common feature disease loss photoreceptor function also seen retinal degeneration slow rds prph mouse homozygous null mutation prph characterized complete failure develop photoreceptor disc outer segment downregulation rhodopsin apoptotic loss photoreceptor cell electroretinogram erg prphrd mouse greatly diminished awave bwave amplitude decline virtually undetectable concentration two month subretinal injection recombinant adenoassociated virus aav encoding prph transgene result stable generation outer segment structure formation new stack disc containing perpherin rhodopsin many case morphologically similar normal outer segment moreover reestablishment structural integrity photoreceptor layer also result electrophysiological correction study demonstrate first time complex ultrastructural cell defect corrected morphologically functionally vivo gene transfer;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Diuretics, potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease.;It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias. If this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible. Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens. Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. The above results indicate that because potassium-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;diuretic potassium arrhythmia hypertensive coronary disease;proposed modest change plasma potassium alter tendency towards cardiac arrhythmia patient coronary artery disease might especially susceptible thus myocardial electrical excitability measured patient mild essential hypertension known coronary artery disease week treatment potassiumconserving diuretic amiloride similar period potassiumlosing diuretic chlorthalidone randomised study plasma potassium concentration average mmoll lower chlorthalidone phase compared amiloride therapy blood pressure volume state assessed bodyweight plasma renin noradrenaline norepinephrine concentration similar regimen compared amiloride treatment chlorthalidone phase associated increased frequency ventricular ectopic beat hour holter monitoring higher lown grading increased upslope duration monophasic action potential prolonged ventricular effective refractory period increased electrical instability programmed ventricular stimulation result indicate potassiumlosing diuretic therapy increase myocardial electrical excitability patient ischaemic heart disease even minor fall plasma potassium concentration probably best avoided patient;diuretic potassium arrhythmia hypertensive coronary disease proposed modest change plasma potassium alter tendency towards cardiac arrhythmia patient coronary artery disease might especially susceptible thus myocardial electrical excitability measured patient mild essential hypertension known coronary artery disease week treatment potassiumconserving diuretic amiloride similar period potassiumlosing diuretic chlorthalidone randomised study plasma potassium concentration average mmoll lower chlorthalidone phase compared amiloride therapy blood pressure volume state assessed bodyweight plasma renin noradrenaline norepinephrine concentration similar regimen compared amiloride treatment chlorthalidone phase associated increased frequency ventricular ectopic beat hour holter monitoring higher lown grading increased upslope duration monophasic action potential prolonged ventricular effective refractory period increased electrical instability programmed ventricular stimulation result indicate potassiumlosing diuretic therapy increase myocardial electrical excitability patient ischaemic heart disease even minor fall plasma potassium concentration probably best avoided patient;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
A novel, multiple symptom model of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors in animals.;BACKGROUND: Current animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically involve acute, drug-induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety. None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD-like behaviors. METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. RESULTS: Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum, whereas serotonin 2C, but not serotonin 1A, receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD-like profile in animals. Moreover, these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to OCD. This novel model of OCD demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease-like systems permanently, which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders.;neurological;novel multiple symptom model obsessivecompulsivelike behavior animal;background current animal model obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd typically involve acute druginduced symptom provocation genetic association stereotypies anxiety none current model demonstrate multiple ocdlike behavior method neonatal rat treated tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine vehicle day twice daily behaviorally tested adulthood result clomipramine exposure immature rat produced significant behavioral biochemical change include enhanced anxiety elevated plus maze marble burying behavioral inflexibility perseveration spontaneous alternation task impaired reversal learning working memory impairment winshift paradigm hoarding corticostriatal dysfunction dopamine receptor elevated striatum whereas serotonin serotonin receptor elevated orbital frontal cortex conclusion first demonstration multiple symptom consistent ocdlike profile animal moreover behavior accompanied biochemical change brain region previously identified relevant ocd novel model ocd demonstrates drug exposure sensitive period program diseaselike system permanently could implication current future therapeutic strategy psychiatric disorder;novel multiple symptom model obsessivecompulsivelike behavior animal background current animal model obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd typically involve acute druginduced symptom provocation genetic association stereotypies anxiety none current model demonstrate multiple ocdlike behavior method neonatal rat treated tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine vehicle day twice daily behaviorally tested adulthood result clomipramine exposure immature rat produced significant behavioral biochemical change include enhanced anxiety elevated plus maze marble burying behavioral inflexibility perseveration spontaneous alternation task impaired reversal learning working memory impairment winshift paradigm hoarding corticostriatal dysfunction dopamine receptor elevated striatum whereas serotonin serotonin receptor elevated orbital frontal cortex conclusion first demonstration multiple symptom consistent ocdlike profile animal moreover behavior accompanied biochemical change brain region previously identified relevant ocd novel model ocd demonstrates drug exposure sensitive period program diseaselike system permanently could implication current future therapeutic strategy psychiatric disorder;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of adenosine in humans.;BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation. The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined. RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h. In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection. The long-lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid.;neurological;preliminary efficacy assessment intrathecal injection american formulation adenosine human;background preclinical study intrathecal adenosine suggest may effective treatment acute chronic pain human preliminary study volunteer patient swedish formulation adenosine suggests may effective hypersensitivity state acute noxious stimulation purpose study screen efficacy different formulation adenosine marketed using acute noxious stimulation capsaicinevoked mechanical hypersensitivity method following food drug administration institutional review board approval written informed consent volunteer studied two trial openlabel doseescalating trial intrathecal adenosine dos doubleblind placebocontrolled trial adenosine cerebrospinal fluid obtained pharmacokinetic analysis pain rating response acute heat stimulus area mechanical hyperalgesia allodynia intradermal capsaicin injection determined result adenosine produced effect pain report acute noxious thermal chemical stimulation reduced mechanical hyperalgesia allodynia intradermal capsaicin injection least contrast residence time adenosine cerebrospinal fluid short conclusion result show selective inhibition intrathecal adenosine hypersensitivity presumed reflect central sensitization human peripheral capsaicin injection longlasting effect consistent observed preliminary report patient chronic neuropathic pain due prolonged residence adenosine cerebrospinal fluid;preliminary efficacy assessment intrathecal injection american formulation adenosine human background preclinical study intrathecal adenosine suggest may effective treatment acute chronic pain human preliminary study volunteer patient swedish formulation adenosine suggests may effective hypersensitivity state acute noxious stimulation purpose study screen efficacy different formulation adenosine marketed using acute noxious stimulation capsaicinevoked mechanical hypersensitivity method following food drug administration institutional review board approval written informed consent volunteer studied two trial openlabel doseescalating trial intrathecal adenosine dos doubleblind placebocontrolled trial adenosine cerebrospinal fluid obtained pharmacokinetic analysis pain rating response acute heat stimulus area mechanical hyperalgesia allodynia intradermal capsaicin injection determined result adenosine produced effect pain report acute noxious thermal chemical stimulation reduced mechanical hyperalgesia allodynia intradermal capsaicin injection least contrast residence time adenosine cerebrospinal fluid short conclusion result show selective inhibition intrathecal adenosine hypersensitivity presumed reflect central sensitization human peripheral capsaicin injection longlasting effect consistent observed preliminary report patient chronic neuropathic pain due prolonged residence adenosine cerebrospinal fluid;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Identification and localization of huntingtin in brain and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with anti-fusion protein antibodies.;The Huntington disease ( HD ) phenotype is associated with expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene , which is predicted to encode a 348-kDa protein named huntington . We used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat , monkey , and human . Western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from control cases . In lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote HD cases , both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed , and increasing repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein . Immunocytochemistry indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain , with the highest levels evident in larger neurons . In the human striatum , huntingtin is enriched in a patch-like distribution , potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in HD . Subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions . Huntingtin appears to particularly associate with microtubules , although some is also associated with synaptic vesicles . On the basis of the localization of huntingtin in association with microtubules , we speculate that the mutation impairs the cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria , vesicles , or other organelles or molecules . .;neurological;identification localization huntingtin brain human lymphoblastoid cell line antifusion protein antibody;huntington disease phenotype associated expansion trinucleotide repeat gene predicted encode kda protein named huntington used polyclonal monoclonal antifusion protein antibody identify native huntingtin rat monkey human western blot revealed protein expected molecular weight present soluble fraction rat monkey brain tissue lymphoblastoid cell control case lymphoblastoid cell line juvenileonset heterozygote case normal mutant huntingtin expressed increasing repeat expansion lead lower level mutant protein immunocytochemistry indicates huntingtin located neuron throughout brain highest level evident larger neuron human striatum huntingtin enriched patchlike distribution potentially corresponding first area affected subcellular localization huntingtin consistent cytosolic protein primarily found somatodendritic region huntingtin appears particularly associate microtubule although also associated synaptic vesicle basis localization huntingtin association microtubule speculate mutation impairs cytoskeletal anchoring transport mitochondrion vesicle organelle molecule;identification localization huntingtin brain human lymphoblastoid cell line antifusion protein antibody huntington disease phenotype associated expansion trinucleotide repeat gene predicted encode kda protein named huntington used polyclonal monoclonal antifusion protein antibody identify native huntingtin rat monkey human western blot revealed protein expected molecular weight present soluble fraction rat monkey brain tissue lymphoblastoid cell control case lymphoblastoid cell line juvenileonset heterozygote case normal mutant huntingtin expressed increasing repeat expansion lead lower level mutant protein immunocytochemistry indicates huntingtin located neuron throughout brain highest level evident larger neuron human striatum huntingtin enriched patchlike distribution potentially corresponding first area affected subcellular localization huntingtin consistent cytosolic protein primarily found somatodendritic region huntingtin appears particularly associate microtubule although also associated synaptic vesicle basis localization huntingtin association microtubule speculate mutation impairs cytoskeletal anchoring transport mitochondrion vesicle organelle molecule;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation in ecstasy users.;Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consolidation. Previous studies indicate that ecstasy users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and sleep-related impairments. We extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy users (n=12) and drug naive healthy controls (n=26). Memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep, with and without interference prior to testing. In addition, we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning, memory and executive functioning. Ecstasy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation, a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference. Additionally, ecstasy users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting frontostriatal and hippocampal neural circuitry, in the domains of proactive interference memory, long-term memory, encoding, working memory and complex planning. We suggest that ecstasy-associated dysfunction in fronto-temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairments in regular ecstasy users.;neurological;dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation ecstasy user;sleep play important role consolidation integration memory process called overnight memory consolidation previous study indicate ecstasy user marked persistent neurocognitive sleeprelated impairment extend past research examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy user drug naive healthy control memory recall word pair evaluated period sleep without interference prior testing addition assessed neurocognitive performance across task learning memory executive functioning ecstasy user demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation finding pronounced following associative interference additionally ecstasy user demonstrated impairment task recruiting frontostriatal hippocampal neural circuitry domain proactive interference memory longterm memory encoding working memory complex planning suggest ecstasyassociated dysfunction frontotemporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairment regular ecstasy user;dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation ecstasy user sleep play important role consolidation integration memory process called overnight memory consolidation previous study indicate ecstasy user marked persistent neurocognitive sleeprelated impairment extend past research examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy user drug naive healthy control memory recall word pair evaluated period sleep without interference prior testing addition assessed neurocognitive performance across task learning memory executive functioning ecstasy user demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation finding pronounced following associative interference additionally ecstasy user demonstrated impairment task recruiting frontostriatal hippocampal neural circuitry domain proactive interference memory longterm memory encoding working memory complex planning suggest ecstasyassociated dysfunction frontotemporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairment regular ecstasy user;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Glyburide-induced hepatitis.;Drug-induced hepatotoxicity, although common, has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas. For glyburide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist. Two patients with type II diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis-like syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy. There was no serologic evidence of viral infection, and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis. Both patients recovered quickly after stopping glyburide therapy and have remained well for a follow-up period of 1 year.

Binasal visual field defects are not specific to vigabatrin.;This study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin (VGB). Two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy (current, previous, or no exposure to VGB). Groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and seizure frequency. All patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function (wide-field multifocal electroretinography) and conventional visual field testing (static perimetry). Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59% of patients currently taking VGB, 43% of patients who previously took VGB, and 24% of patients with no exposure to VGB. Assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48% of current VGB users and 22% of prior VGB users, but in none of the patients without previous exposure to VGB. Bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population, irrespective of drug history.

Functional consequences of mutations in the early growth response 2 gene (EGR2) correlate with severity of human myelinopathies.;The early growth response 2 gene ( EGR2 ) is a Cys2His2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination . This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 ( Egr2 ) knockout mice , which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation . Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 , Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy . Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA-binding domain . The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain ( R1 ) that binds the NAB transcriptional co-repressors . A combination of DNA-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations . The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity . The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB co-repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity . These data provide insight into the possible disease mechanisms underlying EGR2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns . .;neurological;functional consequence mutation early growth response gene egr correlate severity human myelinopathies;early growth response gene egr cyshiszinc finger transcription factor thought play role regulation peripheral nervous system myelination idea based partly phenotype homozygous krox egr knockout mouse display hypomyelination pns block schwann cell early stage differentiation mutation human egr gene recently associated inherited peripheral neuropathy charcotmarietooth type dejerinesottas syndrome congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy three four egr mutation dominant occur within zinc finger dnabinding domain fourth mutation recessive affect inhibitory domain bind nab transcriptional corepressors combination dnabinding assay transcriptional analysis used determine functional consequence mutation zinc finger mutation affect dna binding amount residual binding directly correlate disease severity domain mutation prevents interaction egr nab corepressors thereby increase transcriptional activity data provide insight possible disease mechanism underlying egr mutation reason varying severity difference inheritance pattern;functional consequence mutation early growth response gene egr correlate severity human myelinopathies early growth response gene egr cyshiszinc finger transcription factor thought play role regulation peripheral nervous system myelination idea based partly phenotype homozygous krox egr knockout mouse display hypomyelination pns block schwann cell early stage differentiation mutation human egr gene recently associated inherited peripheral neuropathy charcotmarietooth type dejerinesottas syndrome congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy three four egr mutation dominant occur within zinc finger dnabinding domain fourth mutation recessive affect inhibitory domain bind nab transcriptional corepressors combination dnabinding assay transcriptional analysis used determine functional consequence mutation zinc finger mutation affect dna binding amount residual binding directly correlate disease severity domain mutation prevents interaction egr nab corepressors thereby increase transcriptional activity data provide insight possible disease mechanism underlying egr mutation reason varying severity difference inheritance pattern;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Spontaneous reversion of novel Lesch-Nyhan mutation by HPRT gene rearrangement.;Molecular analysis of an unusual patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome has suggested that the mutation is due to a partial HPRT gene duplication . We now report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant HPRT cDNA which shows the precise duplication of exons 2 and 3 . This mutation is the result of an internal duplication of 16-20 kilobases of the gene . The structure of the mutant gene suggests that the duplication was not generated by a single unequal crossing-over event between two normal HPRT alleles . Growth of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from this patient in selective medium has permitted isolation of spontaneous HPRT + revertants of this mutation . The reversion event involves a second major HPRT gene rearrangement where most or all of the duplicated portion of the mutant gene is deleted . The original mutation therefore has the potential for spontaneous somatic reversion . This may explain the relatively mild symptoms of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome exhibited by this patient . .;neurological;spontaneous reversion novel leschnyhan mutation hprt gene rearrangement;molecular analysis unusual patient leschnyhan syndrome suggested mutation due partial hprt gene duplication report cloning sequencing mutant hprt cdna show precise duplication exon mutation result internal duplication kilobases gene structure mutant gene suggests duplication generated single unequal crossingover event two normal hprt allele growth epsteinbarr virustransformed lymphoblast patient selective medium permitted isolation spontaneous hprt revertants mutation reversion event involves second major hprt gene rearrangement duplicated portion mutant gene deleted original mutation therefore potential spontaneous somatic reversion may explain relatively mild symptom leschnyhan syndrome exhibited patient;spontaneous reversion novel leschnyhan mutation hprt gene rearrangement molecular analysis unusual patient leschnyhan syndrome suggested mutation due partial hprt gene duplication report cloning sequencing mutant hprt cdna show precise duplication exon mutation result internal duplication kilobases gene structure mutant gene suggests duplication generated single unequal crossingover event two normal hprt allele growth epsteinbarr virustransformed lymphoblast patient selective medium permitted isolation spontaneous hprt revertants mutation reversion event involves second major hprt gene rearrangement duplicated portion mutant gene deleted original mutation therefore potential spontaneous somatic reversion may explain relatively mild symptom leschnyhan syndrome exhibited patient;neurological;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Evidence for cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors in man.;"We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol (cardioselective), 40 mg propranolol (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(SEM) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 +/- 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs. The effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV). Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after atenolol. The difference in the effects of the two was significant. After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and atenolol (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol. This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug. While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.";neurological|cardiovascular;evidence cardiac beta adrenoceptors man;compared effect single dos atenolol cardioselective propranolol nonselective placebo exercise isoproterenolinduced tachycardia two experiment involving nine normal subject maximal exercise heart rate reduced sem placebo bpm atenolol bpm propranolol difference drug effect isoproterenol tachycardia determined atropine mgkg isoproterenol sensitivity determined intravenous dose increased heart rate bpm increased microgram placebo microgram propranolol microgram atenolol difference effect two significant atropine unchanged placebo microgram atenolol microgram reduced propranolol microgram remained different atenolol change propranolol sensitivity calculated apparent unchanged atropine mlng data consistent hypothesis exerciseinduced tachycardia result largely beta receptor activation blocked cardioselective nonselective drug whereas isoproterenol activates beta beta receptor cardioselective blockade remains beta component blocked nonselective drug appear beta receptor human heart physiologic pathologic role remain defined;evidence cardiac beta adrenoceptors man compared effect single dos atenolol cardioselective propranolol nonselective placebo exercise isoproterenolinduced tachycardia two experiment involving nine normal subject maximal exercise heart rate reduced sem placebo bpm atenolol bpm propranolol difference drug effect isoproterenol tachycardia determined atropine mgkg isoproterenol sensitivity determined intravenous dose increased heart rate bpm increased microgram placebo microgram propranolol microgram atenolol difference effect two significant atropine unchanged placebo microgram atenolol microgram reduced propranolol microgram remained different atenolol change propranolol sensitivity calculated apparent unchanged atropine mlng data consistent hypothesis exerciseinduced tachycardia result largely beta receptor activation blocked cardioselective nonselective drug whereas isoproterenol activates beta beta receptor cardioselective blockade remains beta component blocked nonselective drug appear beta receptor human heart physiologic pathologic role remain defined;neurological|cardiovascular;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder.;PURPOSE: NGF and PGs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine. We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. Evaluation included patient history, urinalysis, a voiding diary and urodynamic studies. Urine samples were collected. NGF, PGE2, PGF2alpha and PGI2 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups. In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG, and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls (p <0.05). However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB. In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB. CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients.

The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;atrial fibrillation following chemotherapy stage iiie diffuse large bcell gastric lymphoma patient myotonic dystrophy steinerts disease;author describe unusual association diffuse bcell gastric lymphoma myotonic dystrophy common form adult muscular dystrophy sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle doxorubicinbased chemotherapy patient atrial fibrillation cardiac arrhythmia unusual complication patient treated chemotherapy cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated aggressive chemotherapy employed could function triggering factor arrhythmia predisposed myocardium patient;atrial fibrillation following chemotherapy stage iiie diffuse large bcell gastric lymphoma patient myotonic dystrophy steinerts disease author describe unusual association diffuse bcell gastric lymphoma myotonic dystrophy common form adult muscular dystrophy sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle doxorubicinbased chemotherapy patient atrial fibrillation cardiac arrhythmia unusual complication patient treated chemotherapy cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated aggressive chemotherapy employed could function triggering factor arrhythmia predisposed myocardium patient;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block.;"We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block (IBPB). Bupivacaine 0.75% with adrenaline was given followed by a 24-hr continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine. Three audiometric threshold measurements (0.25-18 kHz) were made: the first before IBPB, the second 2-6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation. In four patients hearing impairment on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation, in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day. The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients; in one only low frequencies (0.25-0.5 kHz) were involved. The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of bupivacaine. This patient had hearing threshold changes (15-20 dB) at 6-10 kHz on the opposite side also. IBPB may cause transient auditory dysfunction in the ipsilateral ear, possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation.";hepatorenal;auditory disturbance associated interscalene brachial plexus block;performed audiometric study patient underwent surgery shoulder region interscalene brachial plexus block ibpb bupivacaine adrenaline given followed continuous infusion bupivacaine three audiometric threshold measurement khz made first ibpb second surgery third first day operation four patient hearing impairment side block demonstrated operation three measurement day surgery one following day frequency impairment occurred varied patient one low frequency khz involved maximum change threshold khz measured end continuous infusion bupivacaine patient hearing threshold change khz opposite side also ibpb may cause transient auditory dysfunction ipsilateral ear possibly via effect sympathetic innervation;auditory disturbance associated interscalene brachial plexus block performed audiometric study patient underwent surgery shoulder region interscalene brachial plexus block ibpb bupivacaine adrenaline given followed continuous infusion bupivacaine three audiometric threshold measurement khz made first ibpb second surgery third first day operation four patient hearing impairment side block demonstrated operation three measurement day surgery one following day frequency impairment occurred varied patient one low frequency khz involved maximum change threshold khz measured end continuous infusion bupivacaine patient hearing threshold change khz opposite side also ibpb may cause transient auditory dysfunction ipsilateral ear possibly via effect sympathetic innervation;hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost and phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol.;"Among various oral antiplatelets, a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost (BPT) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (CLZ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate). Thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted. Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT/CLZ in the following schedule; BPT: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, CLZ: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14. At various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed. Throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed. Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one, especially after ingestion of CLZ. All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required. Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol). The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted. In conclusion, the combined administration of BPT/CLZ is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated.";neurological;clinical evaluation combined administration oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol;among various oral antiplatelets combination novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost bpt potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol clz may result untoward clinical effect due possible synergistic elevation intracellular camp cyclic adenosine monophosphate thereby clinical study combined administration two agent attempted twelve healthy volunteer assigned take bptclz following schedule bpt microgram day microgram tid day clz tid day various time interval physical examination blood collection vivo platelet aggregation determination intraplatelet camp performed throughout observation period significant alteration vital sign observed seven subject experienced headache short duration accompanying facial flush one nausea one especially ingestion clz symptom probably caused vasodilating effect two agent mild degree special treatment required intraplatelet camp content gradually significantly increased pmol per platelet day comparison initial value pmol platelet aggregability significantly suppressed various time interval additive synergistic inhibitory effect combined administration noted conclusion combined administration bptclz safe dos used study though beneficial clinical effect combined administration yet elucidated;clinical evaluation combined administration oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol among various oral antiplatelets combination novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost bpt potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol clz may result untoward clinical effect due possible synergistic elevation intracellular camp cyclic adenosine monophosphate thereby clinical study combined administration two agent attempted twelve healthy volunteer assigned take bptclz following schedule bpt microgram day microgram tid day clz tid day various time interval physical examination blood collection vivo platelet aggregation determination intraplatelet camp performed throughout observation period significant alteration vital sign observed seven subject experienced headache short duration accompanying facial flush one nausea one especially ingestion clz symptom probably caused vasodilating effect two agent mild degree special treatment required intraplatelet camp content gradually significantly increased pmol per platelet day comparison initial value pmol platelet aggregability significantly suppressed various time interval additive synergistic inhibitory effect combined administration noted conclusion combined administration bptclz safe dos used study though beneficial clinical effect combined administration yet elucidated;neurological;hepatorenal|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Founding BRCA1 mutations in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in southern Sweden.;Nine different germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene were identified in 15 of 47 kindreds from southern Sweden , by use of SSCP and heteroduplex analysis of all exons and flanking intron region and by a protein-truncation test for exon 11 , followed by direct sequencing . All but one of the mutations are predicted to give rise to premature translation termination and include seven frameshift insertions or deletions , a nonsense mutation , and a splice acceptor site mutation . The remaining mutation is a missense mutation ( Cys61Gly ) in the zinc-binding motif . Four novel Swedish founding mutations were identified  the nucleotide 2595 deletion A was found in five families , the C 1806 T nonsense mutation in three families , the 3166 insertion TGAGA in three families , and the nucleotide 1201 deletion 11 in two families . Analysis of the intragenic polymorphism D17S855 supports common origins of the mutations . Eleven of the 15 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutations were breast-ovarian cancer families , several of them with a predominant ovarian cancer phenotype . The set of 32 families in which no BRCA1 alterations were detected included 1 breast-ovarian cancer kindred manifesting clear linkage to the BRCA1 region and loss of the wild-type chromosome in associated tumors . Other tumor types found in BRCA1 mutation / haplotype carriers included prostatic , pancreas , skin , and lung cancer , a malignant melanoma , an oligodendroglioma , and a carcinosarcoma . In all , 12 of 16 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutation or linkage contained ovarian cancer , as compared with only 6 of the remaining 31 families ( P hereditary breast cancer families often characterized by ovarian cancers .;neurological|oncological;founding brca mutation hereditary breast ovarian cancer southern sweden;nine different germline mutation brca breast ovarian cancer susceptibility gene identified kindred southern sweden use sscp heteroduplex analysis exon flanking intron region proteintruncation test exon followed direct sequencing one mutation predicted give rise premature translation termination include seven frameshift insertion deletion nonsense mutation splice acceptor site mutation remaining mutation missense mutation cysgly zincbinding motif four novel swedish founding mutation identified nucleotide deletion found five family nonsense mutation three family insertion tgaga three family nucleotide deletion two family analysis intragenic polymorphism support common origin mutation eleven kindred manifesting brca mutation breastovarian cancer family several predominant ovarian cancer phenotype set family brca alteration detected included breastovarian cancer kindred manifesting clear linkage brca region loss wildtype chromosome associated tumor tumor type found brca mutation haplotype carrier included prostatic pancreas skin lung cancer malignant melanoma oligodendroglioma carcinosarcoma kindred manifesting brca mutation linkage contained ovarian cancer compared remaining family hereditary breast cancer family often characterized ovarian cancer;founding brca mutation hereditary breast ovarian cancer southern sweden nine different germline mutation brca breast ovarian cancer susceptibility gene identified kindred southern sweden use sscp heteroduplex analysis exon flanking intron region proteintruncation test exon followed direct sequencing one mutation predicted give rise premature translation termination include seven frameshift insertion deletion nonsense mutation splice acceptor site mutation remaining mutation missense mutation cysgly zincbinding motif four novel swedish founding mutation identified nucleotide deletion found five family nonsense mutation three family insertion tgaga three family nucleotide deletion two family analysis intragenic polymorphism support common origin mutation eleven kindred manifesting brca mutation breastovarian cancer family several predominant ovarian cancer phenotype set family brca alteration detected included breastovarian cancer kindred manifesting clear linkage brca region loss wildtype chromosome associated tumor tumor type found brca mutation haplotype carrier included prostatic pancreas skin lung cancer malignant melanoma oligodendroglioma carcinosarcoma kindred manifesting brca mutation linkage contained ovarian cancer compared remaining family hereditary breast cancer family often characterized ovarian cancer;neurological|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial block induced by propranolol.;Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses. These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm. The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen. This was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder.;cardiovascular;alternating sinus rhythm intermittent sinoatrial block induced propranolol;alternating sinus rhythm intermittent sinoatrial block observed yearold woman treatment angina propranolol daily electrocardiogram showed alternation long short interval occasional pause pause always preceded short interval usually followed one two interval representing basic sinus cycle following basic sinus cycle alternating rhythm started longer interval long interval ranged short interval respectively duration pause equal almost equal one short plus one long interval twice basic sinus cycle one recording short period regular sinus rhythm intermittent block observed short period sinus rhythm interrupted sudden prolongation interval starting alternative rhythm small change shape wave interval conduction two pathway first block second longer conduction time occasional block proposed explanation alternating interval electrocardiographic feature seen atropine given intravenously resulted shortening interval without changing rhythm abnormal rhythm disappeared withdrawal propranolol drug restarted block seen accepted evidence propranolol cause conduction disorder;alternating sinus rhythm intermittent sinoatrial block induced propranolol alternating sinus rhythm intermittent sinoatrial block observed yearold woman treatment angina propranolol daily electrocardiogram showed alternation long short interval occasional pause pause always preceded short interval usually followed one two interval representing basic sinus cycle following basic sinus cycle alternating rhythm started longer interval long interval ranged short interval respectively duration pause equal almost equal one short plus one long interval twice basic sinus cycle one recording short period regular sinus rhythm intermittent block observed short period sinus rhythm interrupted sudden prolongation interval starting alternative rhythm small change shape wave interval conduction two pathway first block second longer conduction time occasional block proposed explanation alternating interval electrocardiographic feature seen atropine given intravenously resulted shortening interval without changing rhythm abnormal rhythm disappeared withdrawal propranolol drug restarted block seen accepted evidence propranolol cause conduction disorder;cardiovascular;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Repeated transient anuria following losartan administration in a patient with a solitary kidney.;We report the case of a 70-year-old hypertensive man with a solitary kidney and chronic renal insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after losartan administration. He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, treated with high-dose diuretics. Due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed. Surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria, which lasted eight hours despite high-dose furosemide and amine infusion. One week later, by mistake, losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours. During these two episodes, his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted. Ultimately, an arteriography showed a 70-80% renal artery stenosis. In this patient, renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Under such conditions, angiotensin II receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure. This case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution in this setting.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;repeated transient anuria following losartan administration patient solitary kidney;report case yearold hypertensive man solitary kidney chronic renal insufficiency developed two episode transient anuria losartan administration hospitalized myocardial infarction pulmonary edema treated highdose diuretic due severe systolic dysfunction losartan prescribed surprisingly first dose losartan resulted sudden anuria lasted eight hour despite highdose furosemide amine infusion one week later mistake losartan prescribed second dose patient developed second episode transient anuria lasting hour two episode blood pressure diminished severe hypotension noted ultimately arteriography showed renal artery stenosis patient renal artery stenosis combined heart failure diuretic therapy certainly resulted strong activation reninangiotensin system ra condition angiotensin receptor blockade losartan probably induced critical fall glomerular filtration pressure case report highlight fact angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan cause serious unexpected complication patient renovascular disease used extreme caution setting;repeated transient anuria following losartan administration patient solitary kidney report case yearold hypertensive man solitary kidney chronic renal insufficiency developed two episode transient anuria losartan administration hospitalized myocardial infarction pulmonary edema treated highdose diuretic due severe systolic dysfunction losartan prescribed surprisingly first dose losartan resulted sudden anuria lasted eight hour despite highdose furosemide amine infusion one week later mistake losartan prescribed second dose patient developed second episode transient anuria lasting hour two episode blood pressure diminished severe hypotension noted ultimately arteriography showed renal artery stenosis patient renal artery stenosis combined heart failure diuretic therapy certainly resulted strong activation reninangiotensin system ra condition angiotensin receptor blockade losartan probably induced critical fall glomerular filtration pressure case report highlight fact angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan cause serious unexpected complication patient renovascular disease used extreme caution setting;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Evaluation of the anticocaine monoclonal antibody GNC92H2 as an immunotherapy for cocaine overdose.;The illicit use of cocaine continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for cocaine overdose remains elusive. Current protein-based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream, inactivating its toxic effects. The therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody GNC92H2 was examined using a model of cocaine overdose. Swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg/kg (LD50) of cocaine and GNC92H2 infusions ranging from 30 to 190 mg/kg. GNC92H2 was delivered 30 min before, concomitantly or 3 min after cocaine treatment. Significant blockade of cocaine toxicity was observed with the higher dose of GNC92H2 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, seizures up to 77% and death by 72%. Importantly, GNC92H2 prevented death even post-cocaine injection. The results support the important potential of GNC92H2 as a therapeutic tool against cocaine overdose.;neurological|hepatorenal;evaluation anticocaine monoclonal antibody gnch immunotherapy cocaine overdose;illicit use cocaine continues epidemic proportion treatment cocaine overdose remains elusive current proteinbased technology offer new therapeutic venue antibody bind drug blood stream inactivating toxic effect therapeutic potential anticocaine antibody gnch examined using model cocaine overdose swiss albino mouse prepared intrajugular catheter tested photocell cage administration mgkg cocaine gnch infusion ranging mgkg gnch delivered min concomitantly min cocaine treatment significant blockade cocaine toxicity observed higher dose gnch mgkg premorbid behavior reduced seizure death importantly gnch prevented death even postcocaine injection result support important potential gnch therapeutic tool cocaine overdose;evaluation anticocaine monoclonal antibody gnch immunotherapy cocaine overdose illicit use cocaine continues epidemic proportion treatment cocaine overdose remains elusive current proteinbased technology offer new therapeutic venue antibody bind drug blood stream inactivating toxic effect therapeutic potential anticocaine antibody gnch examined using model cocaine overdose swiss albino mouse prepared intrajugular catheter tested photocell cage administration mgkg cocaine gnch infusion ranging mgkg gnch delivered min concomitantly min cocaine treatment significant blockade cocaine toxicity observed higher dose gnch mgkg premorbid behavior reduced seizure death importantly gnch prevented death even postcocaine injection result support important potential gnch therapeutic tool cocaine overdose;neurological|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
A 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of phenylketonuria.;Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disease due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme , phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . The absence of PAH activity results in typical PKU while persistence of a residual enzyme activity gives rise to variant forms of the disease . We report here a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the PAH gene ( delta 194 ) in a mild variant , with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine ( Km = 160 nM ) , and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype . Since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene , which presents no homology with other hydroxylases , we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine . Finally , since none of the 98 PKU patients tested were found to carry this particular deletion , our study suggests that this molecular event probably occurred recently on the background of a haplotype 2 gene in Portugal . .;neurological|hepatorenal;base pair inframe deletion phenylalanine hydroxylase gene result kinetic variant phenylketonuria;phenylketonuria pku autosomal recessive disease due deficiency hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah absence pah activity result typical pku persistence residual enzyme activity give rise variant form disease report base pair inframe deletion pah gene delta mild variant markedly reduced affinity enzyme phenylalanine provide functional evidence responsibility deletion mutant phenotype since deletion located third exon gene present homology hydroxylases suggest exon involved specificity enzyme phenylalanine finally since none pku patient tested found carry particular deletion study suggests molecular event probably occurred recently background haplotype gene portugal;base pair inframe deletion phenylalanine hydroxylase gene result kinetic variant phenylketonuria phenylketonuria pku autosomal recessive disease due deficiency hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah absence pah activity result typical pku persistence residual enzyme activity give rise variant form disease report base pair inframe deletion pah gene delta mild variant markedly reduced affinity enzyme phenylalanine provide functional evidence responsibility deletion mutant phenotype since deletion located third exon gene present homology hydroxylases suggest exon involved specificity enzyme phenylalanine finally since none pku patient tested found carry particular deletion study suggests molecular event probably occurred recently background haplotype gene portugal;neurological|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
PTEN, a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase gene mutated in human brain, breast, and prostate cancer.;Mapping of homozygous deletions on human chromosome 10q23 has led to the isolation of a candidate tumor suppressor gene , PTEN , that appears to be mutated at considerable frequency in human cancers . In preliminary screens , mutations of PTEN were detected in 31 % ( 13 / 42 ) of glioblastoma cell lines and xenografts , 100 % ( 4 / 4 ) of prostate cancer cell lines , 6 % ( 4 / 65 ) of breast cancer cell lines and xenografts , and 17 % ( 3 / 18 ) of primary glioblastomas . The predicted PTEN product has a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain and extensive homology to tensin , a protein that interacts with actin filaments at focal adhesions . These homologies suggest that PTEN may suppress tumor cell growth by antagonizing protein tyrosine kinases and may regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis through interactions at focal adhesions . .;oncological;pten putative protein tyrosine phosphatase gene mutated human brain breast prostate cancer;mapping homozygous deletion human chromosome led isolation candidate tumor suppressor gene pten appears mutated considerable frequency human cancer preliminary screen mutation pten detected glioblastoma cell line xenograft prostate cancer cell line breast cancer cell line xenograft primary glioblastoma predicted pten product protein tyrosine phosphatase domain extensive homology tensin protein interacts actin filament focal adhesion homology suggest pten may suppress tumor cell growth antagonizing protein tyrosine kinase may regulate tumor cell invasion metastasis interaction focal adhesion;pten putative protein tyrosine phosphatase gene mutated human brain breast prostate cancer mapping homozygous deletion human chromosome led isolation candidate tumor suppressor gene pten appears mutated considerable frequency human cancer preliminary screen mutation pten detected glioblastoma cell line xenograft prostate cancer cell line breast cancer cell line xenograft primary glioblastoma predicted pten product protein tyrosine phosphatase domain extensive homology tensin protein interacts actin filament focal adhesion homology suggest pten may suppress tumor cell growth antagonizing protein tyrosine kinase may regulate tumor cell invasion metastasis interaction focal adhesion;oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart.;The present report describes a case of eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The 47-year-old female patient, known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was admitted with biventricular failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation. On transthoracic echocardiogram, she had moderate left ventricular dysfunction with regional variability and moderate mitral regurgitation. The recipient's heart showed the features of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis with abundant eosinophils. Myocarditis is rare and eosinophilic myocarditis is rarer. It is likely that the hypersensitivity (eosinophilic) myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy. Eosinophilic myocarditis has been reported with an incidence of 2.4% to 7.2% in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy.;cardiovascular;hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart;present report describes case eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy yearold female patient known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy admitted biventricular failure managed aggressively dobutamine infusion drug assessed heart transplantation transthoracic echocardiogram moderate left ventricular dysfunction regional variability moderate mitral regurgitation recipient heart showed feature apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myocarditis abundant eosinophil myocarditis rare eosinophilic myocarditis rarer likely hypersensitivity eosinophilic myocarditis related dobutamine infusion therapy eosinophilic myocarditis reported incidence explanted heart may related multidrug therapy;hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart present report describes case eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy yearold female patient known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy admitted biventricular failure managed aggressively dobutamine infusion drug assessed heart transplantation transthoracic echocardiogram moderate left ventricular dysfunction regional variability moderate mitral regurgitation recipient heart showed feature apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myocarditis abundant eosinophil myocarditis rare eosinophilic myocarditis rarer likely hypersensitivity eosinophilic myocarditis related dobutamine infusion therapy eosinophilic myocarditis reported incidence explanted heart may related multidrug therapy;cardiovascular;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen, adriamycin, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and galactosamine.;In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (CS) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity). However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. Our findings do suggest that CS-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule (non-hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.;cardiovascular;cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodent toxic effect acetaminophen adriamycin carbon tetrachloride chloroform galactosamine;addition use stabilizerrigidifier membrane cholesteryl hemisuccinate tris salt administration also shown protect rat hepatotoxic effect carbon tetrachloride ccl understanding mechanism cytoprotection examined rat mouse protective ability nonhydrolyzable ether form gammacholesteryloxybutyric acid tris salt cse acetaminophen adriamycin carbon tetrachloride chloroform galactosamineinduced toxicity result study demonstrated csmediated protection selective particular specie organ system toxic chemical pretreatment rat mouse single dose mgkg resulted significant protection hepatotoxic effect ccl chcl acetaminophen galactosamine lethal presumably cardiotoxic effect adriamycin administration maximal csmediated protection observed experimental animal pretreated prior toxic insult data suggest intervenes critical cellular event important common pathway toxic cell death mechanism protection appear dependent inhibition chemical bioactivation toxic reactive intermediate light protection observed galactosamine hepatotoxicity however based data presented exclude possibility administration inhibits chemical bioactivation finding suggest csmediated protection dependent action intact anionic molecule nonhydrolyzable cse protective whose mechanism yet defined;cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodent toxic effect acetaminophen adriamycin carbon tetrachloride chloroform galactosamine addition use stabilizerrigidifier membrane cholesteryl hemisuccinate tris salt administration also shown protect rat hepatotoxic effect carbon tetrachloride ccl understanding mechanism cytoprotection examined rat mouse protective ability nonhydrolyzable ether form gammacholesteryloxybutyric acid tris salt cse acetaminophen adriamycin carbon tetrachloride chloroform galactosamineinduced toxicity result study demonstrated csmediated protection selective particular specie organ system toxic chemical pretreatment rat mouse single dose mgkg resulted significant protection hepatotoxic effect ccl chcl acetaminophen galactosamine lethal presumably cardiotoxic effect adriamycin administration maximal csmediated protection observed experimental animal pretreated prior toxic insult data suggest intervenes critical cellular event important common pathway toxic cell death mechanism protection appear dependent inhibition chemical bioactivation toxic reactive intermediate light protection observed galactosamine hepatotoxicity however based data presented exclude possibility administration inhibits chemical bioactivation finding suggest csmediated protection dependent action intact anionic molecule nonhydrolyzable cse protective whose mechanism yet defined;cardiovascular;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Conversion to rapamycin immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients: report of an initial experience.;BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin (RAPA) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses. The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months]. Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients. No relapse of PTLD was observed. Five patients developed pneumonia (two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. There were no deaths. RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, PTLD in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one. RAPA levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal. However, when converting patients to RAPA drug levels should be monitored to avoid over-immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given.;hepatorenal;conversion rapamycin immunosuppression renal transplant recipient report initial experience;background aim study evaluate effect rapa conversion patient undergoing cyclosporine csa tacrolimus tac toxicity method twenty renal transplant recipient switched fixed dose rapamycin rapa mgday month posttransplant drug monitoring initially used adjust dos indication switch chronic csa tac nephrotoxicity acute csa tac toxicity severe facial dysmorphism posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ptld remission hepatotoxicity followup month result patient switched chronic nephrotoxicity significant decrease serum creatinine micromolliter month facial dysmorphism improved two patient relapse ptld observed five patient developed pneumonia two pneumocystis carinii pneumonia one infectious mononucleosis polyclonal ptld lung infiltrate two bronchiolitis obliterans death rapa discontinued four patient pneumonia two ptld one oral aphtous ulcer one rapa level high ngml patient conclusion rapa conversion provides adequate immunosuppression enable csa withdrawal however converting patient rapa drug level monitored avoid overimmunosuppression adequate antiviral pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis given;conversion rapamycin immunosuppression renal transplant recipient report initial experience background aim study evaluate effect rapa conversion patient undergoing cyclosporine csa tacrolimus tac toxicity method twenty renal transplant recipient switched fixed dose rapamycin rapa mgday month posttransplant drug monitoring initially used adjust dos indication switch chronic csa tac nephrotoxicity acute csa tac toxicity severe facial dysmorphism posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ptld remission hepatotoxicity followup month result patient switched chronic nephrotoxicity significant decrease serum creatinine micromolliter month facial dysmorphism improved two patient relapse ptld observed five patient developed pneumonia two pneumocystis carinii pneumonia one infectious mononucleosis polyclonal ptld lung infiltrate two bronchiolitis obliterans death rapa discontinued four patient pneumonia two ptld one oral aphtous ulcer one rapa level high ngml patient conclusion rapa conversion provides adequate immunosuppression enable csa withdrawal however converting patient rapa drug level monitored avoid overimmunosuppression adequate antiviral pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis given;hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone and amiodarone in animals with a healed myocardial infarction.;The hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone, a noniodinated compound structurally related to amiodarone, were compared with those of amiodarone after prolonged oral administration, both at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. All dogs (n = 6) randomly received orally dronedarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), amiodarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), and placebo twice daily for 7 days, with a 3-week washout between consecutive treatments. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MBP), positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (+LVdP/dt), echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and fractional shortening (FS), as well as chronotropic response to isoproterenol and exercise-induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions. Resting values of LVEF, FS, +LVdP/dt, and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting HR was significantly and dose-dependently lowered after dronedarone and to a lesser extent after amiodarone. Both dronedarone and amiodarone significantly reduced the exercise-induced tachycardia and, at the highest dose, decreased the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Thus, dronedarone and amiodarone displayed a similar level of antiadrenergic effect and did not impair the resting left ventricular function. Consequently, dronedarone might be particularly suitable for the treatment and prevention of various clinical arrhythmias, without compromising the left ventricular function.;cardiovascular;hemodynamic antiadrenergic effect dronedarone amiodarone animal healed myocardial infarction;hemodynamic antiadrenergic effect dronedarone noniodinated compound structurally related amiodarone compared amiodarone prolonged oral administration rest sympathetic stimulation conscious dog healed myocardial infarction dog randomly received orally dronedarone mgkg amiodarone mgkg placebo twice daily day week washout consecutive treatment heart rate mean arterial pressure mbp positive rate increase left ventricular pressure lvdpdt echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction lvef fractional shortening well chronotropic response isoproterenol exerciseinduced sympathetic stimulation evaluated baseline posttreatment condition resting value lvef lvdpdt mbp remained unchanged whatever drug dosing regimen whereas resting significantly dosedependently lowered dronedarone lesser extent amiodarone dronedarone amiodarone significantly reduced exerciseinduced tachycardia highest dose decreased isoproterenolinduced tachycardia thus dronedarone amiodarone displayed similar level antiadrenergic effect impair resting left ventricular function consequently dronedarone might particularly suitable treatment prevention various clinical arrhythmia without compromising left ventricular function;hemodynamic antiadrenergic effect dronedarone amiodarone animal healed myocardial infarction hemodynamic antiadrenergic effect dronedarone noniodinated compound structurally related amiodarone compared amiodarone prolonged oral administration rest sympathetic stimulation conscious dog healed myocardial infarction dog randomly received orally dronedarone mgkg amiodarone mgkg placebo twice daily day week washout consecutive treatment heart rate mean arterial pressure mbp positive rate increase left ventricular pressure lvdpdt echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction lvef fractional shortening well chronotropic response isoproterenol exerciseinduced sympathetic stimulation evaluated baseline posttreatment condition resting value lvef lvdpdt mbp remained unchanged whatever drug dosing regimen whereas resting significantly dosedependently lowered dronedarone lesser extent amiodarone dronedarone amiodarone significantly reduced exerciseinduced tachycardia highest dose decreased isoproterenolinduced tachycardia thus dronedarone amiodarone displayed similar level antiadrenergic effect impair resting left ventricular function consequently dronedarone might particularly suitable treatment prevention various clinical arrhythmia without compromising left ventricular function;cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effect of alpha-tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.;Methamphetamine (MA)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals. This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, on the MA-induced neurotoxicity. Male rats were treated with MA (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections). The rat received either alpha-TC (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats. These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO. This suggests that alpha-TC and DFO ameliorate the MA-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.;neurological;effect alphatocopherol deferoxamine methamphetamineinduced neurotoxicity;methamphetamine mainduced dopaminergic neurotoxicity believed associated increased formation free radical study examined effect alphatocopherol alphatc scavenger reactive oxygen specie deferoxamine dfo iron chelator mainduced neurotoxicity male rat treated mgkg every four injection rat received either alphatc mgkg intraperitoneally day min prior administration dfo mgkg subcutaneously min administration concentration dopamine serotonin metabolite decreased significantly administration inhibited alphatc dfo pretreatment alphatc dfo attenuated mainduced hyperthermia well alteration locomotor activity level lipid peroxidation higher reduced glutathione concentration lower matreated rat change significantly attenuated alphatc dfo suggests alphatc dfo ameliorate mainduced neuronal damage decreasing level oxidative stress;effect alphatocopherol deferoxamine methamphetamineinduced neurotoxicity methamphetamine mainduced dopaminergic neurotoxicity believed associated increased formation free radical study examined effect alphatocopherol alphatc scavenger reactive oxygen specie deferoxamine dfo iron chelator mainduced neurotoxicity male rat treated mgkg every four injection rat received either alphatc mgkg intraperitoneally day min prior administration dfo mgkg subcutaneously min administration concentration dopamine serotonin metabolite decreased significantly administration inhibited alphatc dfo pretreatment alphatc dfo attenuated mainduced hyperthermia well alteration locomotor activity level lipid peroxidation higher reduced glutathione concentration lower matreated rat change significantly attenuated alphatc dfo suggests alphatc dfo ameliorate mainduced neuronal damage decreasing level oxidative stress;neurological;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol-induced catalepsy.;The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear. The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar. These findings suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity.;neurological;glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated nmda receptor inferior colliculus modulate haloperidolinduced catalepsy;inferior colliculus primarily involved processing auditory information distinguished auditory nucleus brainstem connection structure motor system functional evidence relating motor behavior derives experiment showing activation electrical stimulation excitatory amino acid microinjection cause freezing escapelike behavior immobility however nature immobility still unclear present study examined influence excitatory amino acidmediated mechanism catalepsy induced dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically mgkg rat haloperidolinduced catalepsy challenged prior intracollicular microinjections glutamate nmda receptor antagonist mmol microl nmol microl nmda receptor agonist nmethyldaspartate nmda nmol microl result showed intracollicular microinjection previous systemic injection haloperidol significantly attenuated catalepsy indicated reduced latency step horizontal bar accordingly intracollicular microinjection nmda increased latency step bar finding suggest glutamatemediated mechanism neural circuit level influence haloperidolinduced catalepsy participate regulation motor activity;glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated nmda receptor inferior colliculus modulate haloperidolinduced catalepsy inferior colliculus primarily involved processing auditory information distinguished auditory nucleus brainstem connection structure motor system functional evidence relating motor behavior derives experiment showing activation electrical stimulation excitatory amino acid microinjection cause freezing escapelike behavior immobility however nature immobility still unclear present study examined influence excitatory amino acidmediated mechanism catalepsy induced dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically mgkg rat haloperidolinduced catalepsy challenged prior intracollicular microinjections glutamate nmda receptor antagonist mmol microl nmol microl nmda receptor agonist nmethyldaspartate nmda nmol microl result showed intracollicular microinjection previous systemic injection haloperidol significantly attenuated catalepsy indicated reduced latency step horizontal bar accordingly intracollicular microinjection nmda increased latency step bar finding suggest glutamatemediated mechanism neural circuit level influence haloperidolinduced catalepsy participate regulation motor activity;neurological;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen.;"A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate, caffeine, and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum. Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine. Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP). The frequency of sound-induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen. In the absence of caffeine, acetaminophen (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS). Acetaminophen (up to 150 micrograms/mL) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into ATP in slices of rat cerebral cortex. Thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the CNS remains unknown.";neurological;reduction caffeine toxicity acetaminophen;patient allegedly consumed tablet overthecounter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate caffeine acetaminophen displayed significant cns stimulation despite presence microgram caffeine per serum salicylate reported augment stimulatory effect caffeine cns attention focused possibility presence acetaminophen microgramsml reduced cns toxicity caffeine study dbaj mouse showed pretreatment acetaminophen mgkg increased interval administration caffeine mgkg onset fatal convulsion factor two pretreatment acetaminophen mgkg reduced incidence audiogenic seizure produced presence caffeine mgkg frequency soundinduced seizure mgkg caffeine reduced acetaminophen absence caffeine acetaminophen mgkg modify seizure induced maximal electroshock alter convulsant dose pentylenetetrezol mouse test performed anticonvulsant screening project nincds acetaminophen microgramsml retard incorporation radioactive adenosine atp slice rat cerebral cortex thus mechanism acetaminophen antagonizes action caffeine cns remains unknown;reduction caffeine toxicity acetaminophen patient allegedly consumed tablet overthecounter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate caffeine acetaminophen displayed significant cns stimulation despite presence microgram caffeine per serum salicylate reported augment stimulatory effect caffeine cns attention focused possibility presence acetaminophen microgramsml reduced cns toxicity caffeine study dbaj mouse showed pretreatment acetaminophen mgkg increased interval administration caffeine mgkg onset fatal convulsion factor two pretreatment acetaminophen mgkg reduced incidence audiogenic seizure produced presence caffeine mgkg frequency soundinduced seizure mgkg caffeine reduced acetaminophen absence caffeine acetaminophen mgkg modify seizure induced maximal electroshock alter convulsant dose pentylenetetrezol mouse test performed anticonvulsant screening project nincds acetaminophen microgramsml retard incorporation radioactive adenosine atp slice rat cerebral cortex thus mechanism acetaminophen antagonizes action caffeine cns remains unknown;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Constitutive and regulated modes of splicing produce six major myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) isoforms with distinct properties.;Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease in adults . The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene , consisting of 15 exons . Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model , we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns . Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8 , which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif , and / or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14 , which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame , occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined . In contrast , the excision of exons 13 / 14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle . We generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length ( heart- , skeletal muscle- or brain-specific ) and two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa ( smooth muscle-specific ) isoforms .

Liposomal daunorubicin in advanced Kaposi's sarcoma: a phase II study.;We report a non-randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) in the treatment of AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma. Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma were entered in the trial. Changes in size, colour and associated oedema of selected 'target' lesions were measured. Clinical, biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed. Ten subjects were evaluated. A partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed. Stabilization of Kaposi's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four. The drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of toxicity. The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity, with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l). There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. In this small patient sample, liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;liposomal daunorubicin advanced kaposis sarcoma phase study;report nonrandomized phase clinical trial assess efficacy safety liposomal daunorubicin daunoxome treatment aid related kaposis sarcoma eleven homosexual men advanced kaposis sarcoma entered trial change size colour associated oedema selected target lesion measured clinical biochemical haematological toxicity assessed ten subject evaluated partial response achieved four two subsequently relapsed stabilization kaposis sarcoma occurred remaining six maintained end trial period four drug generally well tolerated mild symptom toxicity main problem encountered haematological toxicity three subject experiencing severe neutropenia neutrophil count evidence cardiotoxicity small patient sample liposomal daunorubicin effective well tolerated agent treatment kaposis sarcoma;liposomal daunorubicin advanced kaposis sarcoma phase study report nonrandomized phase clinical trial assess efficacy safety liposomal daunorubicin daunoxome treatment aid related kaposis sarcoma eleven homosexual men advanced kaposis sarcoma entered trial change size colour associated oedema selected target lesion measured clinical biochemical haematological toxicity assessed ten subject evaluated partial response achieved four two subsequently relapsed stabilization kaposis sarcoma occurred remaining six maintained end trial period four drug generally well tolerated mild symptom toxicity main problem encountered haematological toxicity three subject experiencing severe neutropenia neutrophil count evidence cardiotoxicity small patient sample liposomal daunorubicin effective well tolerated agent treatment kaposis sarcoma;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Adverse ocular reactions possibly associated with isotretinoin.;"A total of 261 adverse ocular reactions occurred in 237 patients who received isotretinoin, a commonly used drug in the treatment of severe cystic acne. Blepharoconjunctivitis, subjective complaints of dry eyes, blurred vision, contact lens intolerance, and photodermatitis are reversible side effects. More serious ocular adverse reactions include papilledema, pseudotumor cerebri, and white or gray subepithelial corneal opacities; all of these are reversible if the drug is discontinued. Reported cases of decreased dark adaptation are under investigation. Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the many reported congenital abnormalities after maternal use (including microphthalmos, orbital hypertelorism, and optic nerve hypoplasia).";oncological;adverse ocular reaction possibly associated isotretinoin;total adverse ocular reaction occurred patient received isotretinoin commonly used drug treatment severe cystic acne blepharoconjunctivitis subjective complaint dry eye blurred vision contact lens intolerance photodermatitis reversible side effect serious ocular adverse reaction include papilledema pseudotumor cerebri white gray subepithelial corneal opacity reversible drug discontinued reported case decreased dark adaptation investigation isotretinoin contraindicated pregnancy many reported congenital abnormality maternal use including microphthalmos orbital hypertelorism optic nerve hypoplasia;adverse ocular reaction possibly associated isotretinoin total adverse ocular reaction occurred patient received isotretinoin commonly used drug treatment severe cystic acne blepharoconjunctivitis subjective complaint dry eye blurred vision contact lens intolerance photodermatitis reversible side effect serious ocular adverse reaction include papilledema pseudotumor cerebri white gray subepithelial corneal opacity reversible drug discontinued reported case decreased dark adaptation investigation isotretinoin contraindicated pregnancy many reported congenital abnormality maternal use including microphthalmos orbital hypertelorism optic nerve hypoplasia;oncological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Contrast medium nephrotoxicity after renal artery and coronary angioplasty.;BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium (CM) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty (PTRA). PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA (PTRA group, mean age 70+/-12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1.46+/-0.79, range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI (PCI group), matched for basal creatinine (1.44+/-0.6, range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl), gender, and age. In both groups postprocedural (48 h) serum creatinine was measured. RESULTS: Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group (1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl, P=NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group (1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl, P<0.02). Changes in serum creatinine after intervention (after-before) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups (-0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3, P=0.014). This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by CM administration than PCI patients.

Genetic heterogeneity in hereditary breast cancer: role of BRCA1 and BRCA2.;The common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes . However , it is not yet clear what proportion of hereditary breast cancer is explained by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentified susceptibility gene ( s ) . We describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sample of North American hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk . Twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs . Genetic analysis was undertaken to establish linkage between the breast or ovarian cancer cases and markers on chromosomes 17q ( BRCA1 ) and 13q ( BRCA2 ) . Mutation analysis in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was also undertaken in all families . The pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 ( 61 % ) of the 23 families studied was attributed to BRCA1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses . No families were attributed to BRCA2 . Five families ( 22 % ) provided evidence against linkage to both BRCA1 and BRCA2 . No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were detected in these five families . The BRCA1 or BRCA2 status of four families ( 17 % ) could not be determined . BRCA1 and BRCA2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the North American population . However , one or more additional genes may yet be found that explain some proportion of hereditary breast cancer . .;neurological|oncological;genetic heterogeneity hereditary breast cancer role brca brca;common hereditary form breast cancer largely attributed inheritance mutation brca brca gene however yet clear proportion hereditary breast cancer explained brca brca unidentified susceptibility gene describe proportion hereditary breast cancer explained brca brca sample north american hereditary breast cancer assess evidence additional susceptibility gene may confer hereditary breast ovarian cancer risk twentythree family identified two highrisk breast cancer research program genetic analysis undertaken establish linkage breast ovarian cancer case marker chromosome brca brca mutation analysis brca brca gene also undertaken family pattern hereditary cancer family studied attributed brca combination linkage mutation analysis family attributed brca five family provided evidence linkage brca brca brca brca mutation detected five family brca brca status four family could determined brca brca probably explain majority hereditary breast cancer exists north american population however one additional gene may yet found explain proportion hereditary breast cancer;genetic heterogeneity hereditary breast cancer role brca brca common hereditary form breast cancer largely attributed inheritance mutation brca brca gene however yet clear proportion hereditary breast cancer explained brca brca unidentified susceptibility gene describe proportion hereditary breast cancer explained brca brca sample north american hereditary breast cancer assess evidence additional susceptibility gene may confer hereditary breast ovarian cancer risk twentythree family identified two highrisk breast cancer research program genetic analysis undertaken establish linkage breast ovarian cancer case marker chromosome brca brca mutation analysis brca brca gene also undertaken family pattern hereditary cancer family studied attributed brca combination linkage mutation analysis family attributed brca five family provided evidence linkage brca brca brca brca mutation detected five family brca brca status four family could determined brca brca probably explain majority hereditary breast cancer exists north american population however one additional gene may yet found explain proportion hereditary breast cancer;neurological|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Reversal of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy by novel aryl-piperazine anxiolytic drugs.;The novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone, reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol. A series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy. Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy. Drugs with affinity for other 5-HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective. However, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.;neurological;reversal neurolepticinduced catalepsy novel arylpiperazine anxiolytic drug;novel anxiolytic drug buspirone revers catalepsy induced haloperidol series arylpiperazine analogue buspirone hydroxytryptaminergic agonist tested ability reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy drug strong affinity hydroxytryptaminea receptor able reverse catalepsy drug affinity receptor weak affinity ineffective however inhibition postsynaptic receptor neither inhibited potentiated reversal catalepsy leaf open question site mechanism effect;reversal neurolepticinduced catalepsy novel arylpiperazine anxiolytic drug novel anxiolytic drug buspirone revers catalepsy induced haloperidol series arylpiperazine analogue buspirone hydroxytryptaminergic agonist tested ability reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy drug strong affinity hydroxytryptaminea receptor able reverse catalepsy drug affinity receptor weak affinity ineffective however inhibition postsynaptic receptor neither inhibited potentiated reversal catalepsy leaf open question site mechanism effect;neurological;none;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
"Delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium.";A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem, paracetamol, aspirin, isosorbide nitrate, and alcohol. He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids. Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic. He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline (epinephrine). He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours. This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole. It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose. The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;delayed asystolic cardiac arrest diltiazem overdose resuscitation high dose intravenous calcium;year old man took mixed overdose including diltiazem paracetamol aspirin isosorbide nitrate alcohol initially presented hospital six hour mild hypotension treated activated charcoal intravenous fluid eighteen hour overdose two generalised tonicclonic seizure patient remained unresponsive junctional bradycardia unrecordable blood pressure became asystolic resuscitated high dose intravenous calcium adrenaline epinephrine required inotropic support temporary pacing next hour case suggests role aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy severe diltiazem overdose particularly onset asystole considered early case cardiac arrest diltiazem overdose case also highlight problem delayed toxicity whole bowel irrigation administered;delayed asystolic cardiac arrest diltiazem overdose resuscitation high dose intravenous calcium year old man took mixed overdose including diltiazem paracetamol aspirin isosorbide nitrate alcohol initially presented hospital six hour mild hypotension treated activated charcoal intravenous fluid eighteen hour overdose two generalised tonicclonic seizure patient remained unresponsive junctional bradycardia unrecordable blood pressure became asystolic resuscitated high dose intravenous calcium adrenaline epinephrine required inotropic support temporary pacing next hour case suggests role aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy severe diltiazem overdose particularly onset asystole considered early case cardiac arrest diltiazem overdose case also highlight problem delayed toxicity whole bowel irrigation administered;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Animal model of mania induced by ouabain: Evidence of oxidative stress in submitochondrial particles of the rat brain.;The intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ouabain (a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) in rats has been suggested to mimic some symptoms of human bipolar mania. Clinical studies have shown that bipolar disorder may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the ICV administration of ouabain in rats. To achieve this aim, the effects of ouabain injection immediately after and 7 days following a single ICV administration (at concentrations of 10(-2) and 10(-3)M) on locomotion was measured using the open-field test. Additionally, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and superoxide production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala. Our findings demonstrated that ouabain at 10(-2) and 10(-3)M induced hyperlocomotion in rats, and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ICV injection. In addition, we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased TBARS levels and superoxide generation in submitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and amygdala. In conclusion, ouabain-induced mania-like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in bipolar disorder.;neurological;animal model mania induced ouabain evidence oxidative stress submitochondrial particle rat brain;intracerebroventricular icv administration ouabain nakatpase inhibitor rat suggested mimic symptom human bipolar mania clinical study shown bipolar disorder may related mitochondrial dysfunction herein investigated behavioral biochemical effect induced icv administration ouabain rat achieve aim effect ouabain injection immediately day following single icv administration concentration locomotion measured using openfield test additionally thiobarbituric acid reactive substance tbarss superoxide production measured submitochondrial particle prefrontal cortex hippocampus striatum amygdala finding demonstrated ouabain induced hyperlocomotion rat response remained day following single icv injection addition observed persistent increase rat spontaneous locomotion associated increased tbars level superoxide generation submitochondrial particle prefrontal cortex striatum amygdala conclusion ouabaininduced manialike behavior may provide useful animal model test hypothesis involvement oxidative stress bipolar disorder;animal model mania induced ouabain evidence oxidative stress submitochondrial particle rat brain intracerebroventricular icv administration ouabain nakatpase inhibitor rat suggested mimic symptom human bipolar mania clinical study shown bipolar disorder may related mitochondrial dysfunction herein investigated behavioral biochemical effect induced icv administration ouabain rat achieve aim effect ouabain injection immediately day following single icv administration concentration locomotion measured using openfield test additionally thiobarbituric acid reactive substance tbarss superoxide production measured submitochondrial particle prefrontal cortex hippocampus striatum amygdala finding demonstrated ouabain induced hyperlocomotion rat response remained day following single icv injection addition observed persistent increase rat spontaneous locomotion associated increased tbars level superoxide generation submitochondrial particle prefrontal cortex striatum amygdala conclusion ouabaininduced manialike behavior may provide useful animal model test hypothesis involvement oxidative stress bipolar disorder;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
A mouse model for Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting-centre mutations.;Imprinting in the 15q11-q13 region involves an imprinting centre ( IC ) , mapping in part to the promoter and first exon of SNRPN . Deletion of this IC abolishes local paternally derived gene expression and results in Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) . We have created two deletion mutations in mice to understand PWS and the mechanism of this IC . Mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in Snrpn are phenotypically normal , suggesting that mutations of SNRPN are not sufficient to induce PWS . Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS-IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 ( mouse homologue of ZNF127 ) , Ndn and Ipw , and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants . These data demonstrate that both the position of the IC and its role in the coordinate expression of genes is conserved between mouse and human , and indicate that the mouse is a suitable model system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of imprinting in this region of the genome . .;neurological;mouse model praderwilli syndrome imprintingcentre mutation;imprinting region involves imprinting centre mapping part promoter first exon snrpn deletion abolishes local paternally derived gene expression result praderwilli syndrome pws created two deletion mutation mouse understand pws mechanism mouse harbouring intragenic deletion snrpn phenotypically normal suggesting mutation snrpn sufficient induce pws mouse larger deletion involving snrpn putative pwsic lack expression imprinted gene zfp mouse homologue znf ndn ipw manifest several phenotype common pws infant data demonstrate position role coordinate expression gene conserved mouse human indicate mouse suitable model system investigate molecular mechanism imprinting region genome;mouse model praderwilli syndrome imprintingcentre mutation imprinting region involves imprinting centre mapping part promoter first exon snrpn deletion abolishes local paternally derived gene expression result praderwilli syndrome pws created two deletion mutation mouse understand pws mechanism mouse harbouring intragenic deletion snrpn phenotypically normal suggesting mutation snrpn sufficient induce pws mouse larger deletion involving snrpn putative pwsic lack expression imprinted gene zfp mouse homologue znf ndn ipw manifest several phenotype common pws infant data demonstrate position role coordinate expression gene conserved mouse human indicate mouse suitable model system investigate molecular mechanism imprinting region genome;neurological;neurological|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross-react with halothane-induced antibodies.;Two halogenated anesthetics, enflurane and isoflurane, have been associated with an allergic-type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane. Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response. An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients. This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration. The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens.;hepatorenal;halogenated anesthetic form liver adduct antigen crossreact halothaneinduced antibody;two halogenated anesthetic enflurane isoflurane associated allergictype hepatic injury alone following previous exposure halothane halothane hepatitis appears involve aberrant immune response antibody response proteinbound biotransformation product trifluoroacetyl adduct detected halothane hepatitis patient study performed determine crossreactivity enflurane isoflurane hypersensitivity induced halothane subcellular lobular production hepatic neoantigens recognized halothaneinduced antibody following enflurane isoflurane biochemical nature neoantigens investigated two animal model enflurane administration resulted neoantigens detected microsomal cytosolic fraction liver homogenate centrilobular region liver liver biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adduct fold greater guinea pig rat support extends previous evidence mechanism enflurane andor isoflurane could produce hypersensitivity condition similar halothane hepatitis either alone subsequent halothane administration guinea pig would appear useful model investigation immunological response antigen;halogenated anesthetic form liver adduct antigen crossreact halothaneinduced antibody two halogenated anesthetic enflurane isoflurane associated allergictype hepatic injury alone following previous exposure halothane halothane hepatitis appears involve aberrant immune response antibody response proteinbound biotransformation product trifluoroacetyl adduct detected halothane hepatitis patient study performed determine crossreactivity enflurane isoflurane hypersensitivity induced halothane subcellular lobular production hepatic neoantigens recognized halothaneinduced antibody following enflurane isoflurane biochemical nature neoantigens investigated two animal model enflurane administration resulted neoantigens detected microsomal cytosolic fraction liver homogenate centrilobular region liver liver biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adduct fold greater guinea pig rat support extends previous evidence mechanism enflurane andor isoflurane could produce hypersensitivity condition similar halothane hepatitis either alone subsequent halothane administration guinea pig would appear useful model investigation immunological response antigen;hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats.;BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS. METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.;neurological;epileptic seizure following cortical application fibrin sealant containing tranexamic acid rat;background fibrin sealant derived human plasma frequently used neurosurgery order increase clot stability typically contain aprotinin natural fibrinolysis inhibitor recently synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitor tranexamic acid tamca considered substitute aprotinin however tamca shown cause epileptic seizure wanted study whether tamca retains convulsive action incorporated method containing aprotinin different concentration tamca mgml applied pial surface cortex anaesthetized rat response animal evaluated using electroencephalography monitoring clinical behaviour recovery anaesthesia finding containing tamca caused paroxysmal brain activity associated distinct convulsive behaviour degree seizure increased increasing concentration tamca thus containing mgml tamca evoked generalized seizure tested rat lowest concentration tamca mgml evoked brief episode jerkcorrelated convulsive potential rat contrast containing aprotinin evoke paroxysmal activity interpretation tranexamic acid retains convulsive action within thus use containing tamca surgery within close cns may pose substantial risk patient;epileptic seizure following cortical application fibrin sealant containing tranexamic acid rat background fibrin sealant derived human plasma frequently used neurosurgery order increase clot stability typically contain aprotinin natural fibrinolysis inhibitor recently synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitor tranexamic acid tamca considered substitute aprotinin however tamca shown cause epileptic seizure wanted study whether tamca retains convulsive action incorporated method containing aprotinin different concentration tamca mgml applied pial surface cortex anaesthetized rat response animal evaluated using electroencephalography monitoring clinical behaviour recovery anaesthesia finding containing tamca caused paroxysmal brain activity associated distinct convulsive behaviour degree seizure increased increasing concentration tamca thus containing mgml tamca evoked generalized seizure tested rat lowest concentration tamca mgml evoked brief episode jerkcorrelated convulsive potential rat contrast containing aprotinin evoke paroxysmal activity interpretation tranexamic acid retains convulsive action within thus use containing tamca surgery within close cns may pose substantial risk patient;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Identification of WASP mutations, mutation hotspots and genotype-phenotype disparities in 24 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.;The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , an X-linked immunodeficiency disease caused by mutation in the recently isolated gene encoding WAS protein ( WASP ) , is known to be associated with extensive clinical heterogeneity . Cumulative mutation data have revealed that WASP genotypes are also highly variable among WAS patients , but the relationship of phenotype with genotype in this disease remains unclear . To address this issue we characterized WASP mutations in 24 unrelated WAS patients , including 18 boys with severe classical WAS and 6 boys expressing mild forms of the disease , and then examined the degree of correlation of these as well as all previously published WASP mutations with disease severity . By analysis of these compiled mutation data , we demonstrated clustering of WASP mutations within the four most N-terminal exons of the gene and also identified several sites within this region as hotspots for WASP mutation . These characteristics were observed , however , in both severe and mild cases of the disease . Similarly , while the cumulative data revealed a predominance of missense mutations among the WASP gene lesions observed in boys with isolated thrombocytopenia , missense mutations were not exclusively associated with milder WAS phenotypes , but also comprised a substantial portion ( 38 % ) of the WASP gene defects found in patients with severe disease . These findings , as well as the detection of identical WASP mutations in patients with disparate phenotypes , reveal a lack of phenotype concordance with genotype in WAS and thus imply that phenotypic outcome in this disease cannot be reliably predicted solely on the basis of WASP genotypes . .;neurological;identification wasp mutation mutation hotspot genotypephenotype disparity patient wiskottaldrich syndrome;wiskottaldrich syndrome xlinked immunodeficiency disease caused mutation recently isolated gene encoding protein wasp known associated extensive clinical heterogeneity cumulative mutation data revealed wasp genotype also highly variable among patient relationship phenotype genotype disease remains unclear address issue characterized wasp mutation unrelated patient including boy severe classical boy expressing mild form disease examined degree correlation well previously published wasp mutation disease severity analysis compiled mutation data demonstrated clustering wasp mutation within four nterminal exon gene also identified several site within region hotspot wasp mutation characteristic observed however severe mild case disease similarly cumulative data revealed predominance missense mutation among wasp gene lesion observed boy isolated thrombocytopenia missense mutation exclusively associated milder phenotype also comprised substantial portion wasp gene defect found patient severe disease finding well detection identical wasp mutation patient disparate phenotype reveal lack phenotype concordance genotype thus imply phenotypic outcome disease reliably predicted solely basis wasp genotype;identification wasp mutation mutation hotspot genotypephenotype disparity patient wiskottaldrich syndrome wiskottaldrich syndrome xlinked immunodeficiency disease caused mutation recently isolated gene encoding protein wasp known associated extensive clinical heterogeneity cumulative mutation data revealed wasp genotype also highly variable among patient relationship phenotype genotype disease remains unclear address issue characterized wasp mutation unrelated patient including boy severe classical boy expressing mild form disease examined degree correlation well previously published wasp mutation disease severity analysis compiled mutation data demonstrated clustering wasp mutation within four nterminal exon gene also identified several site within region hotspot wasp mutation characteristic observed however severe mild case disease similarly cumulative data revealed predominance missense mutation among wasp gene lesion observed boy isolated thrombocytopenia missense mutation exclusively associated milder phenotype also comprised substantial portion wasp gene defect found patient severe disease finding well detection identical wasp mutation patient disparate phenotype reveal lack phenotype concordance genotype thus imply phenotypic outcome disease reliably predicted solely basis wasp genotype;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in 3390 women with moderate hypercholesterolemia.;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN: The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. SETTING: Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States. PATIENTS: Women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study. RESULTS: Among women, lovastatin (20 to 80 mg/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (P < 0.001): decreases in LDL cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglycerides (9% to 18%), and increases in HDL cholesterol (6.7% to 8.6%). Depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of lovastatin-treated women achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of LDL cholesterol levels less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose. Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg). Estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin. CONCLUSION: Lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in women.";neurological|hepatorenal;efficacy tolerability lovastatin woman moderate hypercholesterolemia;objective evaluate efficacy safety lovastatin woman moderate hypercholesterolemia design expanded clinical evaluation lovastatin excel study multicenter doubleblind diet placebocontrolled trial participant randomly assigned receive placebo lovastatin dos daily twice daily week setting ambulatory patient recruited participating center throughout united state patient woman total cohort volunteer measurement plasma total lowdensity lipoprotein ldl highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol triglyceride laboratory clinical evidence adverse event monitored periodically throughout study result among woman lovastatin mgd produced sustained week doserelated change decrease ldl cholesterol triglyceride increase hdl cholesterol depending dose lovastatintreated woman achieved national cholesterol education program goal ldl cholesterol level less mmoll mgdl achieved goal mmoll mgdl successive transaminase elevation greater three time upper limit normal occurred woman dose dependent dose myopathy defined muscle symptom creatine kinase elevation greater time upper limit normal rare associated highest recommended daily dose lovastatin estrogenreplacement therapy appeared effect either efficacy safety profile lovastatin conclusion lovastatin highly effective generally well tolerated therapy primary hypercholesterolemia woman;efficacy tolerability lovastatin woman moderate hypercholesterolemia objective evaluate efficacy safety lovastatin woman moderate hypercholesterolemia design expanded clinical evaluation lovastatin excel study multicenter doubleblind diet placebocontrolled trial participant randomly assigned receive placebo lovastatin dos daily twice daily week setting ambulatory patient recruited participating center throughout united state patient woman total cohort volunteer measurement plasma total lowdensity lipoprotein ldl highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol triglyceride laboratory clinical evidence adverse event monitored periodically throughout study result among woman lovastatin mgd produced sustained week doserelated change decrease ldl cholesterol triglyceride increase hdl cholesterol depending dose lovastatintreated woman achieved national cholesterol education program goal ldl cholesterol level less mmoll mgdl achieved goal mmoll mgdl successive transaminase elevation greater three time upper limit normal occurred woman dose dependent dose myopathy defined muscle symptom creatine kinase elevation greater time upper limit normal rare associated highest recommended daily dose lovastatin estrogenreplacement therapy appeared effect either efficacy safety profile lovastatin conclusion lovastatin highly effective generally well tolerated therapy primary hypercholesterolemia woman;neurological|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L., crocin on streptozocin-induced model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease in male rats.;"BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, crocins, as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) in male rats was investigated. METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups. In Alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated. In STZ + crocin animal groups, crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days. However, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, Y-maze task was used. RESULTS: It was found out that crocin (30 mg/kg)-treated STZ-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated STZ-injected rats. In addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ-injected group in passive avoidance test. CONCLUSION: Therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.";neurological;effect active constituent crocus sativus crocin streptozocininduced model sporadic alzheimers disease male rat;background involvement watersoluble carotenoid crocins main active component crocus sativus extract learning memory process proposed present study effect crocins sporadic alzheimers disease induced intracerebroventricular icv streptozocin stz male rat investigated method male adult wistar rat divided control crocins mgkg stz stz crocins mgkg group alzheimers disease group rat injected stzicv bilaterally mgkg first day day later similar stzicv application repeated stz crocin animal group crocin applied dos mgkg one day presurgery continued three week prescription crocin dose repeated two day however learning memory performance assessed using passive avoidance paradigm spatial cognition evaluation ymaze task used result found crocin mgkgtreated stzinjected rat show higher correct choice lower error ymaze vehicletreated stzinjected rat addition crocin mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning memory impairment treated stzinjected group passive avoidance test conclusion therefore result demonstrate effectiveness crocin mgkg antagonizing cognitive deficit caused stzicv rat potential treatment neurodegenerative disease alzheimers disease;effect active constituent crocus sativus crocin streptozocininduced model sporadic alzheimers disease male rat background involvement watersoluble carotenoid crocins main active component crocus sativus extract learning memory process proposed present study effect crocins sporadic alzheimers disease induced intracerebroventricular icv streptozocin stz male rat investigated method male adult wistar rat divided control crocins mgkg stz stz crocins mgkg group alzheimers disease group rat injected stzicv bilaterally mgkg first day day later similar stzicv application repeated stz crocin animal group crocin applied dos mgkg one day presurgery continued three week prescription crocin dose repeated two day however learning memory performance assessed using passive avoidance paradigm spatial cognition evaluation ymaze task used result found crocin mgkgtreated stzinjected rat show higher correct choice lower error ymaze vehicletreated stzinjected rat addition crocin mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning memory impairment treated stzinjected group passive avoidance test conclusion therefore result demonstrate effectiveness crocin mgkg antagonizing cognitive deficit caused stzicv rat potential treatment neurodegenerative disease alzheimers disease;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Optimal precurarizing dose of rocuronium to decrease fasciculation and myalgia following succinylcholine administration.;BACKGROUND: Succinylcholine commonly produces frequent adverse effects, including muscle fasciculation and myalgia. The current study identified the optimal dose of rocuronium to prevent succinylcholine-induced fasciculation and myalgia and evaluated the influence of rocuronium on the speed of onset produced by succinylcholine. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded study was conducted in 100 patients randomly allocated into five groups of 20 patients each. Patients were randomized to receive 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium as a precurarizing dose. Neuromuscular monitoring after each precurarizing dose was recorded from the adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography with train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. All patients received succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg at 2 minutes after the precurarization, and were assessed the incidence and severity of fasciculations, while myalgia was assessed at 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence and severity of visible muscle fasciculation was significantly less with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (P < 0.001). Those of myalgia tend to decrease according to increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium, but there was no significance (P = 0.072). The onset time of succinylcholine was significantly longer with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Precurarization with 0.04 mg/kg rocuronium was the optimal dose considering the reduction in the incidence and severity of fasciculation and myalgia with acceptable onset time, and the safe and effective precurarization.;neurological;optimal precurarizing dose rocuronium decrease fasciculation myalgia following succinylcholine administration;background succinylcholine commonly produce frequent adverse effect including muscle fasciculation myalgia current study identified optimal dose rocuronium prevent succinylcholineinduced fasciculation myalgia evaluated influence rocuronium speed onset produced succinylcholine method randomized doubleblinded study conducted patient randomly allocated five group patient patient randomized receive mgkg rocuronium precurarizing dose neuromuscular monitoring precurarizing dose recorded adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography trainoffour stimulation ulnar nerve patient received succinylcholine mgkg minute precurarization assessed incidence severity fasciculation myalgia assessed hour surgery result incidence severity visible muscle fasciculation significantly less increasing amount precurarizing dose rocuronium myalgia tend decrease according increasing amount precurarizing dose rocuronium significance onset time succinylcholine significantly longer increasing amount precurarizing dose rocuronium conclusion precurarization mgkg rocuronium optimal dose considering reduction incidence severity fasciculation myalgia acceptable onset time safe effective precurarization;optimal precurarizing dose rocuronium decrease fasciculation myalgia following succinylcholine administration background succinylcholine commonly produce frequent adverse effect including muscle fasciculation myalgia current study identified optimal dose rocuronium prevent succinylcholineinduced fasciculation myalgia evaluated influence rocuronium speed onset produced succinylcholine method randomized doubleblinded study conducted patient randomly allocated five group patient patient randomized receive mgkg rocuronium precurarizing dose neuromuscular monitoring precurarizing dose recorded adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography trainoffour stimulation ulnar nerve patient received succinylcholine mgkg minute precurarization assessed incidence severity fasciculation myalgia assessed hour surgery result incidence severity visible muscle fasciculation significantly less increasing amount precurarizing dose rocuronium myalgia tend decrease according increasing amount precurarizing dose rocuronium significance onset time succinylcholine significantly longer increasing amount precurarizing dose rocuronium conclusion precurarization mgkg rocuronium optimal dose considering reduction incidence severity fasciculation myalgia acceptable onset time safe effective precurarization;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Sirolimus-associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction.;Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor-containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase. Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed. Further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future.;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological;sirolimusassociated proteinuria renal dysfunction;sirolimus novel immunosuppressant potent antiproliferative action ability inhibit raptorcontaining mammalian target rapamycin protein kinase sirolimus represents major therapeutic advance prevention acute renal allograft rejection chronic allograft nephropathy role therapy glomerulonephritis autoimmunity cystic renal disease renal cancer investigation sirolimus share vasomotor renal adverse effect exhibited calcineurin inhibitor designated nonnephrotoxic drug however clinical report suggest circumstance sirolimus associated proteinuria acute renal dysfunction common risk factor appears presence preexisting chronic renal damage mechanism sirolimusassociated proteinuria multifactorial may due increase glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal also suggested sirolimus directly cause increased glomerular permeabilityinjury evidence mechanism currently inconclusive acute renal dysfunction associated sirolimus delayed graft function may due suppression compensatory renal cell proliferation survivalrepair process although adverse effect occur patient occurrence could minimised knowledge molecular effect sirolimus kidney use sirolimus appropriate patient population close monitoring proteinuria renal function use angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker proteinuria occurs withdrawal needed longterm analysis renal allograft study using sirolimus novo immunosuppression along clinical laboratory study refine issue future;sirolimusassociated proteinuria renal dysfunction sirolimus novel immunosuppressant potent antiproliferative action ability inhibit raptorcontaining mammalian target rapamycin protein kinase sirolimus represents major therapeutic advance prevention acute renal allograft rejection chronic allograft nephropathy role therapy glomerulonephritis autoimmunity cystic renal disease renal cancer investigation sirolimus share vasomotor renal adverse effect exhibited calcineurin inhibitor designated nonnephrotoxic drug however clinical report suggest circumstance sirolimus associated proteinuria acute renal dysfunction common risk factor appears presence preexisting chronic renal damage mechanism sirolimusassociated proteinuria multifactorial may due increase glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal also suggested sirolimus directly cause increased glomerular permeabilityinjury evidence mechanism currently inconclusive acute renal dysfunction associated sirolimus delayed graft function may due suppression compensatory renal cell proliferation survivalrepair process although adverse effect occur patient occurrence could minimised knowledge molecular effect sirolimus kidney use sirolimus appropriate patient population close monitoring proteinuria renal function use angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker proteinuria occurs withdrawal needed longterm analysis renal allograft study using sirolimus novo immunosuppression along clinical laboratory study refine issue future;neurological|hepatorenal|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Ifosfamide related encephalopathy: the need for a timely EEG evaluation.;"BACKGROUND: Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including sarcomas, lymphoma, gynecologic and testicular cancers. Encephalopathy has been reported in 10-40% of patients receiving high-dose IV ifosfamide. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the role of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the early detection and management of ifosfamide related encephalopathy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review including clinical data and EEG recordings was done on five patients, admitted to MD Anderson Cancer Center between years 2009 and 2012, who developed ifosfamide related acute encephalopathy. RESULTS: All five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after (within 12 h-2 days) receiving ifosfamide. Two patients developed generalized convulsions while one patient developed continuous non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) that required ICU admission and intubation. Initial EEG showed epileptiform discharges in three patients; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing. Mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted. Repeat EEGs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of ifosfamide related encephalopathy correlates with EEG changes.

A Japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy with a codon 291 deletion: a clinical, biochemical, pathological, and genetic report.;We report a Japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) with a three base pair deletion ( delGAG 291 ) in the ALD gene . A variety of phenotypes were observed within this family . While the proband ( patient 1 ) was classified as having a rare intermediate type of adult cerebral and cerebello-brain stem forms , his younger brother ( patient 2 ) and nephew ( patient 3 ) had a childhood ALD type . Another nephew ( patient 4 ) of patient 1 was classified as having an adolescent form . The tau level in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) in patient 1 was as high as that of patients with Alzheimers disease ( AD ) . His brain magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) showed abnormalities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and brain stem , but not in the cerebral white matter , where marked reductions of the cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were clearly demonstrated by positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In patients 2 and 3 , the autopsy findings showed massive demyelination of the cerebral white matter with sparing of the U-fibers , compatible with the findings of childhood ALD . Oleic and erucic acids ( Lorenzos Oil ) were administered to patients 1 and 4 , but sufficient effectiveness was not obtained . The findings in this family suggest that delGAG291 is part of the cause of Japanese ALD with phenotypic variations . Moreover , although the scale of the study is limited , there is a possibility that PET can detect an insidious lesion which is undetectable by computed tomogram ( CT ) or MRI analysis , and that the higher level of tau reflects the process of neuronal degeneration in ALD .

Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.;The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.;neurological;neural correlate sketamine induced psychosis overt continuous verbal fluency;glutamatergic nmethyldaspartate nmda receptor implicated pathophysiology schizophrenia administered healthy volunteer subanesthetic dose noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist ketamine lead psychopathological symptom similar observed schizophrenia patient schizophrenia ketamine exacerbates core symptom illness supporting hypothesis glutamatergic dysfunction counterbalanced placebocontrolled doubleblind study design healthy subject administered continuous subanesthetic sketamine infusion difference bold response measured fmri detected scanning period subject performed continuous overt verbal fluency task phonological lexical semantic ketamineinduced psychopathological symptom assessed positive negative syndrome scale panss ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology posthoc ttests revealed significant difference placebo ketamine amount word generated lexical semantic verbal fluency phonological domain remained unaffected ketamine led enhanced cortical activation supramarginal frontal brain region phonological lexical verbal fluency semantic verbal fluency ketamine induces activation change healthy subject similar observed patient schizophrenia particularly frontal temporal brain region result provide support hypothesis nmda receptor dysfunction pathophysiology schizophrenia;neural correlate sketamine induced psychosis overt continuous verbal fluency glutamatergic nmethyldaspartate nmda receptor implicated pathophysiology schizophrenia administered healthy volunteer subanesthetic dose noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist ketamine lead psychopathological symptom similar observed schizophrenia patient schizophrenia ketamine exacerbates core symptom illness supporting hypothesis glutamatergic dysfunction counterbalanced placebocontrolled doubleblind study design healthy subject administered continuous subanesthetic sketamine infusion difference bold response measured fmri detected scanning period subject performed continuous overt verbal fluency task phonological lexical semantic ketamineinduced psychopathological symptom assessed positive negative syndrome scale panss ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology posthoc ttests revealed significant difference placebo ketamine amount word generated lexical semantic verbal fluency phonological domain remained unaffected ketamine led enhanced cortical activation supramarginal frontal brain region phonological lexical verbal fluency semantic verbal fluency ketamine induces activation change healthy subject similar observed patient schizophrenia particularly frontal temporal brain region result provide support hypothesis nmda receptor dysfunction pathophysiology schizophrenia;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Mutations of the VHL gene in sporadic renal cell carcinoma: definition of a risk factor for VHL patients to develop an RCC.;To investigate the nature of somatic von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) mutations , we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene , using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis ( SSCP ) of DNA . We detected abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples . After sequencing , we identified microdeletions in 58 % of cases , microinsertions in 17 % , nonsense mutations in 8 % , and missense mutations in 17 % . Among these mutations , 50 % correspond to new mutations . VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) subtype , as previously reported . To compare somatic and germline mutations , we used the VHL database , which includes 507 mutations . The study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78 % of somatic mutations vs only 37 % in germline mutations ( P VHL mutations is associated with sporadic RCC . This pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations . We then analyzed the occurrence of RCC in VHL families , based on the nature of mutations .

Time dependence of plasma malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides during incomplete cerebral ischemia in the rat.;"Incomplete cerebral ischemia (30 min) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries. Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times (once every 5 min) before ischemia (0 time) and 5, 15, and 30 min after ischemia. Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides. During ischemia, a time-dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed. Plasma malondialdehyde, which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078). Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia, the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia, although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher. The present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";neurological;time dependence plasma malondialdehyde oxypurines nucleoside incomplete cerebral ischemia rat;incomplete cerebral ischemia min induced rat bilaterally clamping common carotid artery peripheral venous blood sample withdrawn femoral vein four time every min ischemia time min ischemia plasma extract analyzed highly sensitive highperformance liquid chromatographic method direct determination malondialdehyde oxypurines nucleoside ischemia timedependent increase plasma oxypurines nucleoside observed plasma malondialdehyde present minimal amount zero time mumolliter plasma increased min ischemia resulting fivefold increase min carotid occlusion mumolliter plasma increased plasma malondialdehyde also recorded two group animal subjected experimental model one receiving mgkg cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately ischemia receiving microgramskg hypotensive drug nitroprusside flow rate microlitersmin intravenously ischemia although latter group malondialdehyde significantly higher present data indicate determination malondialdehyde oxypurines nucleoside peripheral blood may used monitor metabolic alteration tissue occurring ischemic phenomenaabstract truncated word;time dependence plasma malondialdehyde oxypurines nucleoside incomplete cerebral ischemia rat incomplete cerebral ischemia min induced rat bilaterally clamping common carotid artery peripheral venous blood sample withdrawn femoral vein four time every min ischemia time min ischemia plasma extract analyzed highly sensitive highperformance liquid chromatographic method direct determination malondialdehyde oxypurines nucleoside ischemia timedependent increase plasma oxypurines nucleoside observed plasma malondialdehyde present minimal amount zero time mumolliter plasma increased min ischemia resulting fivefold increase min carotid occlusion mumolliter plasma increased plasma malondialdehyde also recorded two group animal subjected experimental model one receiving mgkg cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately ischemia receiving microgramskg hypotensive drug nitroprusside flow rate microlitersmin intravenously ischemia although latter group malondialdehyde significantly higher present data indicate determination malondialdehyde oxypurines nucleoside peripheral blood may used monitor metabolic alteration tissue occurring ischemic phenomenaabstract truncated word;neurological;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Bradycardia due to biperiden.;In a 38-year-old male patient suffering from a severe postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia, intravenous application of 10 mg biperiden lactate led to a long-lasting paradoxical reaction characterized by considerable bradycardia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. The heart rate was back to normal within 12 hours upon administration of orciprenaline under cardiac monitoring in an intensive care unit. Bradycardia induced by biperiden is attributed to the speed of injection and to a dose-related dual effect of atropine-like drugs on muscarine receptors.;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;bradycardia due biperiden;yearold male patient suffering severe postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia intravenous application biperiden lactate led longlasting paradoxical reaction characterized considerable bradycardia dysarthria dysphagia heart rate back normal within hour upon administration orciprenaline cardiac monitoring intensive care unit bradycardia induced biperiden attributed speed injection doserelated dual effect atropinelike drug muscarine receptor;bradycardia due biperiden yearold male patient suffering severe postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia intravenous application biperiden lactate led longlasting paradoxical reaction characterized considerable bradycardia dysarthria dysphagia heart rate back normal within hour upon administration orciprenaline cardiac monitoring intensive care unit bradycardia induced biperiden attributed speed injection doserelated dual effect atropinelike drug muscarine receptor;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Adenomatous polyposis coli and carcinoma of the rectum were subsequently diagnosed in the patient . She was profoundly mentally retarded , autistic , and had minor dysmorphic features consistent with those of previous patients with similar deletions . The deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion ( dir ins ( 5 ) ( q22 . 3q14 . 2q15 ) ) found in the patients mother .

Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2/D3 and alpha1-adrenergic up-regulation.;Trimipramine (TRI), which shows a clinical antidepressant activity, is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation. The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants. TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days. In the acute experiment TRI (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats. TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine, quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine D2 and D3 effects). The stereotypies induced by d-amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI. It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor. It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists. A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity.;neurological|hepatorenal;repeated trimipramine induces dopamine alphaadrenergic upregulation;trimipramine tri show clinical antidepressant activity chemically related imipramine inhibit reuptake noradrenaline hydroxytryptamine induce betaadrenergic downregulation mechanism antidepressant activity still unknown aim present study find whether tri given repeatedly able induce adaptive change dopaminergic alphaadrenergic system demonstrated previously various antidepressant tri given male wistar rat male albino swiss mouse perorally twice daily day acute experiment tri given antagonize reserpine hypothermia mouse potentiate hydroxytryptophan head twitch rat tri given repeatedly rat increase locomotor hyperactivity induced damphetamine quinpirole hydroxydipropyloaminotetralin dopamine effect stereotypies induced damphetamine apomorphine potentiated tri increase behaviour stimulation evoked phenylephrine given intraventricularly rat evaluated open field test well aggressiveness evoked clonidine mouse effect mediated alphaadrenergic receptor may concluded like tricyclic antidepressant studied previously tri given repeatedly increase responsiveness brain dopamine locomotor activity stereotypy well alphaadrenergic receptor agonist question arises whether reuptake inhibition importance adaptive change induced repeated antidepressant suggested responsible antidepressant activity;repeated trimipramine induces dopamine alphaadrenergic upregulation trimipramine tri show clinical antidepressant activity chemically related imipramine inhibit reuptake noradrenaline hydroxytryptamine induce betaadrenergic downregulation mechanism antidepressant activity still unknown aim present study find whether tri given repeatedly able induce adaptive change dopaminergic alphaadrenergic system demonstrated previously various antidepressant tri given male wistar rat male albino swiss mouse perorally twice daily day acute experiment tri given antagonize reserpine hypothermia mouse potentiate hydroxytryptophan head twitch rat tri given repeatedly rat increase locomotor hyperactivity induced damphetamine quinpirole hydroxydipropyloaminotetralin dopamine effect stereotypies induced damphetamine apomorphine potentiated tri increase behaviour stimulation evoked phenylephrine given intraventricularly rat evaluated open field test well aggressiveness evoked clonidine mouse effect mediated alphaadrenergic receptor may concluded like tricyclic antidepressant studied previously tri given repeatedly increase responsiveness brain dopamine locomotor activity stereotypy well alphaadrenergic receptor agonist question arises whether reuptake inhibition importance adaptive change induced repeated antidepressant suggested responsible antidepressant activity;neurological|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

In vivo evidences suggesting the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity: protection by erdosteine.;The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin (VCM)-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to investigate the role of erdosteine, an expectorant agent, which has also antioxidant properties, on kidney tissue against the possible VCM-induced renal impairment in rats. Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200mgkg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine was administered orally. VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion, and increased SOD activity, but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone. Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity. There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups. Erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the VCM-induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.;neurological|hepatorenal;vivo evidence suggesting role oxidative stress pathogenesis vancomycininduced nephrotoxicity protection erdosteine;aim study examine vancomycin vcminduced oxidative stress promotes production reactive oxygen specie ro investigate role erdosteine expectorant agent also antioxidant property kidney tissue possible vcminduced renal impairment rat rat divided three group sham vcm vcm plus erdosteine vcm administrated intraperitoneally mgkg twice daily day erdosteine administered orally vcm administration control rat significantly increased renal malondialdehyde mda urinary nacetylbetadglucosaminidase nag marker renal tubular injury excretion decreased superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat activity erdosteine administration vcm injection caused significantly decreased renal mda urinary nag excretion increased sod activity cat activity renal tissue compared vcm alone erdosteine showed histopathological protection vcminduced nephrotoxicity significant dilatation tubular lumen extensive epithelial cell vacuolization atrophy desquamation necrosis vcmtreated rat control erdosteine group erdosteine caused marked reduction extent tubular damage concluded oxidative tubular damage play important role vcminduced nephrotoxicity modulation oxidative stress erdosteine reduces vcminduced kidney damage biochemical histological level;vivo evidence suggesting role oxidative stress pathogenesis vancomycininduced nephrotoxicity protection erdosteine aim study examine vancomycin vcminduced oxidative stress promotes production reactive oxygen specie ro investigate role erdosteine expectorant agent also antioxidant property kidney tissue possible vcminduced renal impairment rat rat divided three group sham vcm vcm plus erdosteine vcm administrated intraperitoneally mgkg twice daily day erdosteine administered orally vcm administration control rat significantly increased renal malondialdehyde mda urinary nacetylbetadglucosaminidase nag marker renal tubular injury excretion decreased superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat activity erdosteine administration vcm injection caused significantly decreased renal mda urinary nag excretion increased sod activity cat activity renal tissue compared vcm alone erdosteine showed histopathological protection vcminduced nephrotoxicity significant dilatation tubular lumen extensive epithelial cell vacuolization atrophy desquamation necrosis vcmtreated rat control erdosteine group erdosteine caused marked reduction extent tubular damage concluded oxidative tubular damage play important role vcminduced nephrotoxicity modulation oxidative stress erdosteine reduces vcminduced kidney damage biochemical histological level;neurological|hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

The central nervous system ( CNS ) of Atm-null mice shows a pronounced defect in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress , suggesting ATM functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage . Here , we report that the death effector Bax is required for a large proportion of Atm-dependent apoptosis in the developing CNS after ionizing radiation ( IR ) . Although many of the same regions of the CNS in both Bax- / - and Atm- / - mice were radioresistant , mice nullizygous for both Bax and Atm showed additional reduction in IR-induced apoptosis in the CNS . Therefore , although the major IR-induced apoptotic pathway in the CNS requires Atm and Bax , a p53-dependent collateral pathway exists that has both Atm- and Bax-independent branches . Further , Atm- and Bax-dependent apoptosis in the CNS also required caspase-3 activation . These data implicate Bax and caspase-3 as death effectors in neurodegenerative pathways . .;neurological|oncological;atm bax cooperate ionizing radiationinduced apoptosis central nervous system;ataxiatelangiectasia hereditary multisystemic disease resulting mutation ataxia telangiectasia mutated atm characterized neurodegeneration cancer immune defect hypersensitivity ionizing radiation molecular detail atm function nervous system unclear although neurological lesion ataxiatelangiectasia becomes apparent early life suggesting developmental origin central nervous system cns atmnull mouse show pronounced defect apoptosis induced genotoxic stress suggesting atm function eliminate neuron excessive genomic damage report death effector bax required large proportion atmdependent apoptosis developing cns ionizing radiation although many region cns bax atm mouse radioresistant mouse nullizygous bax atm showed additional reduction irinduced apoptosis cns therefore although major irinduced apoptotic pathway cns requires atm bax pdependent collateral pathway exists atm baxindependent branch atm baxdependent apoptosis cns also required caspase activation data implicate bax caspase death effector neurodegenerative pathway;atm bax cooperate ionizing radiationinduced apoptosis central nervous system ataxiatelangiectasia hereditary multisystemic disease resulting mutation ataxia telangiectasia mutated atm characterized neurodegeneration cancer immune defect hypersensitivity ionizing radiation molecular detail atm function nervous system unclear although neurological lesion ataxiatelangiectasia becomes apparent early life suggesting developmental origin central nervous system cns atmnull mouse show pronounced defect apoptosis induced genotoxic stress suggesting atm function eliminate neuron excessive genomic damage report death effector bax required large proportion atmdependent apoptosis developing cns ionizing radiation although many region cns bax atm mouse radioresistant mouse nullizygous bax atm showed additional reduction irinduced apoptosis cns therefore although major irinduced apoptotic pathway cns requires atm bax pdependent collateral pathway exists atm baxindependent branch atm baxdependent apoptosis cns also required caspase activation data implicate bax caspase death effector neurodegenerative pathway;neurological|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717).;CB 3717, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]CB 3717, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as CB 3717 tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than CB 3717, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity. In early clinical studies with CB 3717, activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients. Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects. Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients. Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved.;hepatorenal|oncological;recent preclinical clinical study thymidylate synthase inhibitor npropargyldideazafolic acid;npropargyldideazafolic acid tightbinding inhibitor thymidylate synthase whose cytotoxicity mediated solely inhibition enzyme recent preclinical study focused intracellular formation polyglutamates following hour exposure cell microm hcb extractable radioactivity could accounted tetra pentaglutamate determined highpressure liquid chromatography hplc analysis inhibitor isolated tri tetra pentaglutamate fold potent respectively formation may therefore important determinant cytotoxicity early clinical study activity seen breast cancer ovarian cancer hepatoma mesothelioma toxicity included hepatotoxicity malaise doselimiting nephrotoxicity latter effect thought due drug precipitation within renal tubule result poor solubility acidic condition attempt overcome problem clinical trial administered alkaline diuresis way preliminary result mgm suggest reduction nephrotoxicity may achieved instance renal toxicity patient hepatotoxicity malaise frequent side effect evidence antitumor activity seen patient pharmacokinetic investigation shown alkaline diuresis alter plasma level urinary excretion satisfactory urinary alkalinization readily achieved;recent preclinical clinical study thymidylate synthase inhibitor npropargyldideazafolic acid npropargyldideazafolic acid tightbinding inhibitor thymidylate synthase whose cytotoxicity mediated solely inhibition enzyme recent preclinical study focused intracellular formation polyglutamates following hour exposure cell microm hcb extractable radioactivity could accounted tetra pentaglutamate determined highpressure liquid chromatography hplc analysis inhibitor isolated tri tetra pentaglutamate fold potent respectively formation may therefore important determinant cytotoxicity early clinical study activity seen breast cancer ovarian cancer hepatoma mesothelioma toxicity included hepatotoxicity malaise doselimiting nephrotoxicity latter effect thought due drug precipitation within renal tubule result poor solubility acidic condition attempt overcome problem clinical trial administered alkaline diuresis way preliminary result mgm suggest reduction nephrotoxicity may achieved instance renal toxicity patient hepatotoxicity malaise frequent side effect evidence antitumor activity seen patient pharmacokinetic investigation shown alkaline diuresis alter plasma level urinary excretion satisfactory urinary alkalinization readily achieved;hepatorenal|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on bupropion hydrochloride-induced seizures in mice.;"BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion-induced seizures. This is important, since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates. METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg, a known convulsive dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion-induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded. RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99.8% reduction at 240 min. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel.";neurological;effect increasing intraperitoneal infusion rate bupropion hydrochlorideinduced seizure mouse;background known relationship input rate incidence bupropioninduced seizure important since different controlled release formulation bupropion release active drug different rate method investigated effect varying intraperitoneal infusion rate bupropion hcl mgkg known convulsive dose incidence severity bupropioninduced convulsion swiss albino mouse total mouse approximately week age weighing randomly assigned bupropion hcl mgkg treatment intraperitoneal administration group animal per group bupropion hcl infused surgically implanted dosing catheter infusion group min min min min min min min number time onset duration intensity convulsion absence convulsion recorded result result showed administration bupropion hcl mgkg bolus injection induced convulsion mouse convulsing mouse group logistic regression analysis revealed infusion time significant odds ratio increasing infusion time bupropion hcl mgkg associated reduced odds convulsion infusion time min compared bolus injection increase infusion time resulted reduction odds convulsion reduction min conclusion conclusion demonstration inverse relationship infusion time fixed convulsive dose bupropion risk convulsion prospective study novel;effect increasing intraperitoneal infusion rate bupropion hydrochlorideinduced seizure mouse background known relationship input rate incidence bupropioninduced seizure important since different controlled release formulation bupropion release active drug different rate method investigated effect varying intraperitoneal infusion rate bupropion hcl mgkg known convulsive dose incidence severity bupropioninduced convulsion swiss albino mouse total mouse approximately week age weighing randomly assigned bupropion hcl mgkg treatment intraperitoneal administration group animal per group bupropion hcl infused surgically implanted dosing catheter infusion group min min min min min min min number time onset duration intensity convulsion absence convulsion recorded result result showed administration bupropion hcl mgkg bolus injection induced convulsion mouse convulsing mouse group logistic regression analysis revealed infusion time significant odds ratio increasing infusion time bupropion hcl mgkg associated reduced odds convulsion infusion time min compared bolus injection increase infusion time resulted reduction odds convulsion reduction min conclusion conclusion demonstration inverse relationship infusion time fixed convulsive dose bupropion risk convulsion prospective study novel;neurological;hepatorenal|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Atrial thrombosis involving the heart of F-344 rats ingesting quinacrine hydrochloride.;Quinacrine hydrochloride is toxic for the heart of F-344 rats. Rats treated with 500 ppm quinacrine hydrochloride in the diet all developed a high incidence of left atrial thrombosis. The lesion was associated with cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation and focal myocardial degeneration. Rats died from cardiac hypertrophy with severe acute and chronic congestion of the lungs, liver, and other organs. Seventy percent of rats given 250 ppm quinacrine hydrochloride and 1,000 ppm sodium nitrite simultaneously in the diet had thrombosis of the atria of the heart, while untreated control rats in this laboratory did not have atrial thrombosis.

Acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin.;"INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic-associated hepatotoxicity is rare. With widespread use of antimicrobial agents, however, hepatic injury occurs frequently, and among adverse drug reactions, idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious. CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old male patient, with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department, Istanbul, Turkey, with 5 days' history of jaundice, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg/d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior. Admission laboratory tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 67 U/L (reference range, 10-37 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 98 U/L (10-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U/L (0-270 U/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U/L (7-49 U/L); amylase, 46 U/L (0-220 U/L); total bilirubin, 20.1 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 14.8 mg/dL (0-0.3 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dL (3.5-5.4 mg/dL). No toxin, alcohol, or other drugs were reported. The patient had suffered a previous episode of ""acute hepatitis of unknown origin,"" that occurred after telithromycin usage. Both incidents occurred within a year. DISCUSSION: Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use. It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction. Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic hepatitis. Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time. CONCLUSION: Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin.";hepatorenal;acute hepatitis attack exposure telithromycin;introduction antibioticassociated hepatotoxicity rare widespread use antimicrobial agent however hepatic injury occurs frequently among adverse drug reaction idiosyncratic reaction serious case summary yearold male patient height weight presented marmara university hospital emergency department istanbul turkey day history jaundice malaise nausea vomiting prescribed telithromycin mgd treat upper respiratory tract infection day prior admission laboratory test follows alanine aminotransferase reference range aspartate aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase gammaglutamyltransferase amylase total bilirubin mgdl mgdl direct bilirubin mgdl mgdl albumin mgdl mgdl toxin alcohol drug reported patient suffered previous episode acute hepatitis unknown origin occurred telithromycin usage incident occurred within year discussion telithromycin first ketolide antibacterial receive food drug administration approval clinical use associated infrequent usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction based score naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale telithromycin probable cause acute hepatitis patient pathological finding suggested druginduced toxic hepatitis recurrence hepatitis attack might avoided initial incident communicated attending physician prescribed telithromycin second time conclusion report case acute hepatitis probably associated administration telithromycin;acute hepatitis attack exposure telithromycin introduction antibioticassociated hepatotoxicity rare widespread use antimicrobial agent however hepatic injury occurs frequently among adverse drug reaction idiosyncratic reaction serious case summary yearold male patient height weight presented marmara university hospital emergency department istanbul turkey day history jaundice malaise nausea vomiting prescribed telithromycin mgd treat upper respiratory tract infection day prior admission laboratory test follows alanine aminotransferase reference range aspartate aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase gammaglutamyltransferase amylase total bilirubin mgdl mgdl direct bilirubin mgdl mgdl albumin mgdl mgdl toxin alcohol drug reported patient suffered previous episode acute hepatitis unknown origin occurred telithromycin usage incident occurred within year discussion telithromycin first ketolide antibacterial receive food drug administration approval clinical use associated infrequent usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction based score naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale telithromycin probable cause acute hepatitis patient pathological finding suggested druginduced toxic hepatitis recurrence hepatitis attack might avoided initial incident communicated attending physician prescribed telithromycin second time conclusion report case acute hepatitis probably associated administration telithromycin;hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Effects of the antidepressant trazodone, a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist, on dopamine-dependent behaviors in rats.;RATIONALE: 5-Hydroxytryptamine, via stimulation of 5-HT 2C receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas activation of 5-HT 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission. The antidepressant trazodone is a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system. METHODS: The effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine- and apomorphine-induced oral stereotypies, on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), on ergometrine-induced wet dog shake (WDS) behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections was studied in rats. We also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy in rats. RESULTS: Trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p. did not induce catalepsy, and did not antagonize apomorphine (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) stereotypy and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. However, pretreatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy, and antagonized haloperidol catalepsy, ergometrine-induced WDS behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections. Trazodone at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p. induced catalepsy and antagonized apomorphine and dexamphetamine stereotypies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors. Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, trazodone blocks 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors. We suggest that trazodone (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5-HT, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.;neurological;effect antidepressant trazodone receptor antagonist dopaminedependent behavior rat;rationale hydroxytryptamine via stimulation receptor exerts tonic inhibitory influence dopaminergic neurotransmission whereas activation receptor enhances stimulated daergic neurotransmission antidepressant trazodone receptor antagonist objective evaluate effect trazodone treatment behavior dependent functional status nigrostriatal daergic system method effect pretreatment trazodone dexamphetamine apomorphineinduced oral stereotypies catalepsy induced haloperidol apomorphine mgkg ergometrineinduced wet dog shake wds behavior fluoxetineinduced penile erection studied rat also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy rat result trazodone mgkg induce catalepsy antagonize apomorphine mgkg stereotypy apomorphine mgkginduced catalepsy however pretreatment mgkg trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy antagonized haloperidol catalepsy ergometrineinduced wds behavior fluoxetineinduced penile erection trazodone mgkg induced catalepsy antagonized apomorphine dexamphetamine stereotypies conclusion result indicate trazodone mgkg block pre postsynaptic striatal receptor mgkg block postsynaptic striatal receptor furthermore mgkg trazodone block receptor suggest trazodone mgkg blocking receptor release nigrostriatal daergic neuron tonic inhibition caused thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy;effect antidepressant trazodone receptor antagonist dopaminedependent behavior rat rationale hydroxytryptamine via stimulation receptor exerts tonic inhibitory influence dopaminergic neurotransmission whereas activation receptor enhances stimulated daergic neurotransmission antidepressant trazodone receptor antagonist objective evaluate effect trazodone treatment behavior dependent functional status nigrostriatal daergic system method effect pretreatment trazodone dexamphetamine apomorphineinduced oral stereotypies catalepsy induced haloperidol apomorphine mgkg ergometrineinduced wet dog shake wds behavior fluoxetineinduced penile erection studied rat also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy rat result trazodone mgkg induce catalepsy antagonize apomorphine mgkg stereotypy apomorphine mgkginduced catalepsy however pretreatment mgkg trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy antagonized haloperidol catalepsy ergometrineinduced wds behavior fluoxetineinduced penile erection trazodone mgkg induced catalepsy antagonized apomorphine dexamphetamine stereotypies conclusion result indicate trazodone mgkg block pre postsynaptic striatal receptor mgkg block postsynaptic striatal receptor furthermore mgkg trazodone block receptor suggest trazodone mgkg blocking receptor release nigrostriatal daergic neuron tonic inhibition caused thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are improved by fluoxetine.;We evaluated the severity of motor disability and dyskinesias in seven levodopa-responsive patients with Parkinson's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist, apomorphine, before and after the administration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice per day) for 11 +/- 1 days. After fluoxetine treatment, there was a significant 47% improvement (p < 0.05) of apomorphine-induced dyskinesias without modification of parkinsonian motor disability. The dyskinesias were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dystonic dyskinesias (onset- and end-of-dose dyskinesias) and in the upper limbs during choreic mid-dose dyskinesias. The results suggest that increased brain serotoninergic transmission with fluoxetine may reduce levodopa- or dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesias without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability.;neurological;levodopainduced dyskinesia improved fluoxetine;evaluated severity motor disability dyskinesia seven levodoparesponsive patient parkinson disease acute challenge mixed dopamine agonist apomorphine administration fluoxetine twice per day day fluoxetine treatment significant improvement apomorphineinduced dyskinesia without modification parkinsonian motor disability dyskinesia reduced predominantly lower limb onset disappearance dystonic dyskinesia onset endofdose dyskinesia upper limb choreic middose dyskinesia result suggest increased brain serotoninergic transmission fluoxetine may reduce levodopa dopamine agonistinduced dyskinesia without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability;levodopainduced dyskinesia improved fluoxetine evaluated severity motor disability dyskinesia seven levodoparesponsive patient parkinson disease acute challenge mixed dopamine agonist apomorphine administration fluoxetine twice per day day fluoxetine treatment significant improvement apomorphineinduced dyskinesia without modification parkinsonian motor disability dyskinesia reduced predominantly lower limb onset disappearance dystonic dyskinesia onset endofdose dyskinesia upper limb choreic middose dyskinesia result suggest increased brain serotoninergic transmission fluoxetine may reduce levodopa dopamine agonistinduced dyskinesia without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability;neurological;hepatorenal|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Multiple origins for phenylketonuria in Europe.;Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among Caucasians and other ethnic groups , is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder , with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the PAH gene . The haplotype associations , relative frequencies , and distributions of five prevalent PAH mutations ( R158Q , R261Q , IVS10nt546 , R408W , and IVS12n1 ) were established in a comprehensive European sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major PKU alleles . Each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight RFLPs in or near the PAH gene . These findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago . From the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout Europe , four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups . Together , these data suggest that there were multiple , geographically and ethnically distinct origins for PKU within the European population . .;neurological|hepatorenal;multiple origin phenylketonuria europe;phenylketonuria pku disorder amino acid metabolism prevalent among caucasian ethnic group caused primarily deficiency hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah pku highly heterogeneous disorder molecular lesion identified pah gene haplotype association relative frequency distribution five prevalent pah mutation ivsnt ivsn established comprehensive european sample population subsequently examined determine potential role several genetic mechanism explaining present distribution major pku allele five mutation strongly associated one chromosomal haplotype defined eight rflps near pah gene finding suggest mutation arose single founding event occurred within time period ranging several hundred several thousand year ago significant difference observed relative frequency distribution five allele throughout europe four putative founding event could localized specific ethnic subgroup together data suggest multiple geographically ethnically distinct origin pku within european population;multiple origin phenylketonuria europe phenylketonuria pku disorder amino acid metabolism prevalent among caucasian ethnic group caused primarily deficiency hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah pku highly heterogeneous disorder molecular lesion identified pah gene haplotype association relative frequency distribution five prevalent pah mutation ivsnt ivsn established comprehensive european sample population subsequently examined determine potential role several genetic mechanism explaining present distribution major pku allele five mutation strongly associated one chromosomal haplotype defined eight rflps near pah gene finding suggest mutation arose single founding event occurred within time period ranging several hundred several thousand year ago significant difference observed relative frequency distribution five allele throughout europe four putative founding event could localized specific ethnic subgroup together data suggest multiple geographically ethnically distinct origin pku within european population;neurological|hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer with paclitaxel: a phase II trial.;"Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma. Two phase II trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2. Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV NSCLC. Paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication. Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%). Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2. Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy. Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia/arthralgia was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4. Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4. Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated, and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.";neurological|oncological;chemotherapy advanced inoperable nonsmall cell lung cancer paclitaxel phase trial;paclitaxel taxol bristolmyers squibb company princeton demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity different tumor type notably ovarian breast carcinoma two phase trial hour paclitaxel infusion chemotherapynaive patient stage iiib nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc reported response rate leukopenia dose limiting many patient experienced grade leukopenia investigated efficacy toxicity hour paclitaxel infusion phase trial patient inoperable stage iiib nsclc patient treated men woman median age year age range performance status patient stage nsclc paclitaxel mgm infused hour every week standard prophylactic premedication patient evaluable response partial remission change disease progression hematologic toxicity mild one patient developed grade neutropenia grade grade polyneuropathy affected patient one experienced severe polyneuropathy similarly grade myalgiaarthralgia observed patient experienced grade nausea vomiting infrequent patient experiencing grade experiencing grade paclitaxel thus active single agent patient population hour infusion proving comparably effective hour infusion superior term incidence hematologic nonhematologic toxicity phase study paclitaxel combined drug active nsclc indicated phase iii study comparing paclitaxel standard chemotherapy remain completed;chemotherapy advanced inoperable nonsmall cell lung cancer paclitaxel phase trial paclitaxel taxol bristolmyers squibb company princeton demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity different tumor type notably ovarian breast carcinoma two phase trial hour paclitaxel infusion chemotherapynaive patient stage iiib nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc reported response rate leukopenia dose limiting many patient experienced grade leukopenia investigated efficacy toxicity hour paclitaxel infusion phase trial patient inoperable stage iiib nsclc patient treated men woman median age year age range performance status patient stage nsclc paclitaxel mgm infused hour every week standard prophylactic premedication patient evaluable response partial remission change disease progression hematologic toxicity mild one patient developed grade neutropenia grade grade polyneuropathy affected patient one experienced severe polyneuropathy similarly grade myalgiaarthralgia observed patient experienced grade nausea vomiting infrequent patient experiencing grade experiencing grade paclitaxel thus active single agent patient population hour infusion proving comparably effective hour infusion superior term incidence hematologic nonhematologic toxicity phase study paclitaxel combined drug active nsclc indicated phase iii study comparing paclitaxel standard chemotherapy remain completed;neurological|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
A common molecular basis for rearrangement disorders on chromosome 22q11.;The chromosome 22q11 region is susceptible to rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders and malignant tumors . Three congenital anomaly disorders , cat-eye syndrome , der ( ) syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome / DiGeorge syndrome ( VCFS / DGS ) are associated with tetrasomy , trisomy or monosomy , respectively , for part of chromosome 22q11 . VCFS / DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements . In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements , the deletion end-points in a large number of VCFS / DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis . Most VCFS / DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion , some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1 . 5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations . The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements . To investigate this hypothesis , we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS / DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats , termed LCR22s . To support this idea further , we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS / DGS patients . We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events , thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders . We identified five additional copies of the LCR22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to disease .;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;common molecular basis rearrangement disorder chromosome;chromosome region susceptible rearrangement associated congenital anomaly disorder malignant tumor three congenital anomaly disorder cateye syndrome der syndrome velocardiofacial syndrome digeorge syndrome vcfs dg associated tetrasomy trisomy monosomy respectively part chromosome vcfs dg common syndrome associated rearrangement order determine whether particular region prone rearrangement deletion endpoint large number vcfs dg patient defined haplotype analysis vcfs dg patient similar deletion nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting deletion rare patient unique deletion translocation high prevalence disorder population fact case occur sporadically suggest sequence near breakpoints confer susceptibility chromosome rearrangement investigate hypothesis developed hamsterhuman somatic hybrid cell line vcfs dg patient three class deletion show breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeat termed lcrs support idea identified family carry interstitial duplication region deleted vcfs dg patient present model explain lcrs mediate different homologous recombination event thereby generating number rearrangement associated congenital anomaly disorder identified five additional copy lcr may mediate rearrangement leading disease;common molecular basis rearrangement disorder chromosome chromosome region susceptible rearrangement associated congenital anomaly disorder malignant tumor three congenital anomaly disorder cateye syndrome der syndrome velocardiofacial syndrome digeorge syndrome vcfs dg associated tetrasomy trisomy monosomy respectively part chromosome vcfs dg common syndrome associated rearrangement order determine whether particular region prone rearrangement deletion endpoint large number vcfs dg patient defined haplotype analysis vcfs dg patient similar deletion nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting deletion rare patient unique deletion translocation high prevalence disorder population fact case occur sporadically suggest sequence near breakpoints confer susceptibility chromosome rearrangement investigate hypothesis developed hamsterhuman somatic hybrid cell line vcfs dg patient three class deletion show breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeat termed lcrs support idea identified family carry interstitial duplication region deleted vcfs dg patient present model explain lcrs mediate different homologous recombination event thereby generating number rearrangement associated congenital anomaly disorder identified five additional copy lcr may mediate rearrangement leading disease;neurological|cardiovascular|oncological;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Gene transfer and expression of human phenylalanine hydroxylase.;Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is caused by a genetic deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . A full-length complementary DNA clone of human PAH was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector and transferred into mouse NIH3T3 cells which do not normally express PAH . The transformed mouse cells expressed PAH messenger RNA , immunoreactive protein , and enzymatic activity that are characteristic of the normal human liver products , demonstrating that a single gene contains all of the necessary genetic information to code for functional PAH . These results support the use of the human PAH probe in prenatal diagnosis and detection of carriers , to provide new opportunities for the biochemical characterization of normal and mutant enzymes , and in the investigation of alternative genetic therapies for PKU . .;hepatorenal;gene transfer expression human phenylalanine hydroxylase;phenylketonuria pku caused genetic deficiency enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah fulllength complementary dna clone human pah inserted eukaryotic expression vector transferred mouse niht cell normally express pah transformed mouse cell expressed pah messenger rna immunoreactive protein enzymatic activity characteristic normal human liver product demonstrating single gene contains necessary genetic information code functional pah result support use human pah probe prenatal diagnosis detection carrier provide new opportunity biochemical characterization normal mutant enzyme investigation alternative genetic therapy pku;gene transfer expression human phenylalanine hydroxylase phenylketonuria pku caused genetic deficiency enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah fulllength complementary dna clone human pah inserted eukaryotic expression vector transferred mouse niht cell normally express pah transformed mouse cell expressed pah messenger rna immunoreactive protein enzymatic activity characteristic normal human liver product demonstrating single gene contains necessary genetic information code functional pah result support use human pah probe prenatal diagnosis detection carrier provide new opportunity biochemical characterization normal mutant enzyme investigation alternative genetic therapy pku;hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated pacemaker channels by clonidine.;"BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.";cardiovascular;direct inhibition cardiac hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotidegated pacemaker channel clonidine;background inhibition cardiac sympathetic tone represents important strategy treatment cardiovascular disease including arrhythmia coronary heart disease chronic heart failure activation presynaptic alphaadrenoceptors widely accepted mechanism action antisympathetic drug clonidine however target protein postulated contribute vivo action clonidine method result test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effect independent alphaadrenoceptors generated mouse targeted deletion alphaadrenoceptor subtypes alphaabc alphaabc mouse completely unresponsive analgesic hypnotic effect clonidine however clonidine significantly lowered heart rate alphaabc mouse bpm clonidineinduced bradycardia conscious alphaabc mouse microgkg microgkg effect wildtype mouse similar bradycardic effect clonidine observed isolated spontaneously beating right atrium alphaabcknockout wildtype mouse clonidine inhibited native pacemaker current isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cell ifgenerating hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotidegated hcn hcn channel transfected hek cell consequence blocking clonidine reduced slope diastolic depolarization frequency pacemaker potential sinoatrial node cell wildtype alphaabcknockout mouse conclusion direct inhibition cardiac hcn pacemaker channel contributes bradycardic effect clonidine genetargeted mouse vivo thus clonidinelike drug represent novel structure future hcn channel inhibitor;direct inhibition cardiac hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotidegated pacemaker channel clonidine background inhibition cardiac sympathetic tone represents important strategy treatment cardiovascular disease including arrhythmia coronary heart disease chronic heart failure activation presynaptic alphaadrenoceptors widely accepted mechanism action antisympathetic drug clonidine however target protein postulated contribute vivo action clonidine method result test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effect independent alphaadrenoceptors generated mouse targeted deletion alphaadrenoceptor subtypes alphaabc alphaabc mouse completely unresponsive analgesic hypnotic effect clonidine however clonidine significantly lowered heart rate alphaabc mouse bpm clonidineinduced bradycardia conscious alphaabc mouse microgkg microgkg effect wildtype mouse similar bradycardic effect clonidine observed isolated spontaneously beating right atrium alphaabcknockout wildtype mouse clonidine inhibited native pacemaker current isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cell ifgenerating hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotidegated hcn hcn channel transfected hek cell consequence blocking clonidine reduced slope diastolic depolarization frequency pacemaker potential sinoatrial node cell wildtype alphaabcknockout mouse conclusion direct inhibition cardiac hcn pacemaker channel contributes bradycardic effect clonidine genetargeted mouse vivo thus clonidinelike drug represent novel structure future hcn channel inhibitor;cardiovascular;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Glycopyrronium requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of edrophonium.;We have compared, in 60 adult patients, the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 and 10 micrograms kg-1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before edrophonium 1 mg kg-1. Significant differences between the four groups were detected (P less than 0.001). Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg-1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min-1 (95% confidence limits 28-32 beat min-1). Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the edrophonium, was sufficient to minimize early, edrophonium-induced bradycardias.

Intra-arterial BCNU chemotherapy for treatment of malignant gliomas of the central nervous system.;Because of the rapid systemic clearance of BCNU (1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea), intra-arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Thirty-six patients were treated with BCNU every 6 to 8 weeks, either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system, beginning with a dose of 200 mg/sq m body surface area. Twelve patients with Grade III or IV astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therapy. After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy, nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans. In the nine responders, median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks (range 12 to more than 91 weeks). The median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks (range 21 to more than 156 weeks), with an 18-month survival rate of 42%. Twenty-four patients with recurrent Grade I to IV astrocytomas, whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed, received two to eight courses of intra-arterial BCNU therapy. Seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks (range 6 to more than 66 weeks). The catheterization procedure is safe, with no immediate complication in 111 infusions of BCNU. A delayed complication in nine patients has been unilateral loss of vision secondary to a retinal vasculitis.

Milk-alkali syndrome induced by 1,25(OH)2D in a patient with hypoparathyroidism.;Milk-alkali syndrome was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali. Although with current ulcer therapy (H-2 blockers, omeprazole, and sucralfate), the frequency of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly, the classic triad of hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal impairment remains the hallmark of the syndrome. Milk-alkali syndrome can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately. This article presents a patient with hypoparathyroidism who was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk-alkali syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous pamidronate on his first admission and with hydrocortisone on the second. This illustrates intravenous pamidronate as a valuable therapeutic tool when milk-alkali syndrome presents as hypercalcemic emergency.;hepatorenal;milkalkali syndrome induced ohd patient hypoparathyroidism;milkalkali syndrome first described year ago context treatment peptic ulcer disease large amount calcium alkali although current ulcer therapy blocker omeprazole sucralfate frequency milkalkali syndrome decreased significantly classic triad hypercalcemia alkalosis renal impairment remains hallmark syndrome milkalkali syndrome present serious occasionally lifethreatening illness unless diagnosed treated appropriately article present patient hypoparathyroidism treated calcium carbonate calcitriol resulting two admission hospital milkalkali syndrome patient successfully treated intravenous pamidronate first admission hydrocortisone second illustrates intravenous pamidronate valuable therapeutic tool milkalkali syndrome present hypercalcemic emergency;milkalkali syndrome induced ohd patient hypoparathyroidism milkalkali syndrome first described year ago context treatment peptic ulcer disease large amount calcium alkali although current ulcer therapy blocker omeprazole sucralfate frequency milkalkali syndrome decreased significantly classic triad hypercalcemia alkalosis renal impairment remains hallmark syndrome milkalkali syndrome present serious occasionally lifethreatening illness unless diagnosed treated appropriately article present patient hypoparathyroidism treated calcium carbonate calcitriol resulting two admission hospital milkalkali syndrome patient successfully treated intravenous pamidronate first admission hydrocortisone second illustrates intravenous pamidronate valuable therapeutic tool milkalkali syndrome present hypercalcemic emergency;hepatorenal;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Clinical experiences in an open and a double-blind trial.;"A total of sixty patients were trated with bromperidol first in open conditions (20 patients), then on a double blind basis (40 patients) with haloperidol as the reference substance. The open study lasted for four weeks; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets. The daily dose (initial dose: 1 mg; mean dose at the end of the trial: 4.47 mg) was always administered in one single dose. Nineteen patients finished the trial, and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good. These results were confirmed by statistical analysis. Nine patients exhibited mild to moderate extrapyramidal concomitant symptoms; no other side effects were observed. The results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects.

Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.;BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning. RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure. These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children. However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.;neurological;succimer chelation improves learning attention arousal regulation leadexposed rat produce lasting cognitive impairment absence lead exposure;background growing pressure clinician prescribe chelation therapy slightly elevated blood lead level however study evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcome pbexposed child whether agent adverse effect may affect brain development absence exposure objective present study designed answer question using rodent model early childhood exposure treatment succimer widely used chelating agent treatment poisoning result exposure produced lasting impairment learning attention inhibitory control arousal regulation paralleling area dysfunction seen pbexposed child succimer treatment pbexposed rat significantly improved learning attention arousal regulation although efficacy treatment varied function exposure level specific functional deficit contrast succimer treatment rat previously exposed produced lasting pervasive cognitive affective dysfunction comparable magnitude produced higher exposure regimen conclusion first data knowledge show treatment chelating agent alleviate cognitive deficit due exposure finding suggest may possible identify succimer treatment protocol improves cognitive outcome pbexposed child however also suggest succimer treatment strongly discouraged child elevated tissue level heavy metal;succimer chelation improves learning attention arousal regulation leadexposed rat produce lasting cognitive impairment absence lead exposure background growing pressure clinician prescribe chelation therapy slightly elevated blood lead level however study evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcome pbexposed child whether agent adverse effect may affect brain development absence exposure objective present study designed answer question using rodent model early childhood exposure treatment succimer widely used chelating agent treatment poisoning result exposure produced lasting impairment learning attention inhibitory control arousal regulation paralleling area dysfunction seen pbexposed child succimer treatment pbexposed rat significantly improved learning attention arousal regulation although efficacy treatment varied function exposure level specific functional deficit contrast succimer treatment rat previously exposed produced lasting pervasive cognitive affective dysfunction comparable magnitude produced higher exposure regimen conclusion first data knowledge show treatment chelating agent alleviate cognitive deficit due exposure finding suggest may possible identify succimer treatment protocol improves cognitive outcome pbexposed child however also suggest succimer treatment strongly discouraged child elevated tissue level heavy metal;neurological;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
The identical 5' splice-site acceptor mutation in five attenuated APC families from Newfoundland demonstrates a founder effect.;Inherited mutations of the APC gene predispose carriers to multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and rectum and to colorectal cancer . Mutations located at the extreme 5 end of the APC gene , however , are associated with a less severe disease known as attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ) . Many individuals with AAPC develop relatively few colorectal polyps but are still at high risk for colorectal cancer . We report here the identification of a 5 APC germline mutation in five separately ascertained AAPC families from Newfoundland , Canada . This disease-causing mutation is a single basepair change ( G to A ) in the splice-acceptor region of APC intron 3 that creates a mutant RNA without exon 4 of APC . The observation of the same APC mutation in five families from the same geographic area demonstrates a founder effect . Furthermore , the identification of this germline mutation strengthens the correlation between the 5 location of an APC disease-causing mutation and the attenuated polyposis phenotype . .;oncological;identical splicesite acceptor mutation five attenuated apc family newfoundland demonstrates founder effect;inherited mutation apc gene predispose carrier multiple adenomatous polyp colon rectum colorectal cancer mutation located extreme end apc gene however associated less severe disease known attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli aapc many individual aapc develop relatively colorectal polyp still high risk colorectal cancer report identification apc germline mutation five separately ascertained aapc family newfoundland canada diseasecausing mutation single basepair change spliceacceptor region apc intron creates mutant rna without exon apc observation apc mutation five family geographic area demonstrates founder effect furthermore identification germline mutation strengthens correlation location apc diseasecausing mutation attenuated polyposis phenotype;identical splicesite acceptor mutation five attenuated apc family newfoundland demonstrates founder effect inherited mutation apc gene predispose carrier multiple adenomatous polyp colon rectum colorectal cancer mutation located extreme end apc gene however associated less severe disease known attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli aapc many individual aapc develop relatively colorectal polyp still high risk colorectal cancer report identification apc germline mutation five separately ascertained aapc family newfoundland canada diseasecausing mutation single basepair change spliceacceptor region apc intron creates mutant rna without exon apc observation apc mutation five family geographic area demonstrates founder effect furthermore identification germline mutation strengthens correlation location apc diseasecausing mutation attenuated polyposis phenotype;oncological;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine.;Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency. The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.;neurological;diet promoting sugar dependency cause behavioral crosssensitization low dose amphetamine;previous research laboratory shown diet intermittent excessive sugar consumption produce state neurochemical behavioral similarity drug dependency present study examined whether female rat various regimen sugar access would show behavioral crosssensitization low dose amphetamine min baseline measure locomotor activity day animal maintained cyclic diet deprivation followed access sucrose solution chow pellet access starting onset dark period day locomotor activity measured min beginning day sugar access beginning day rat maintained libitum chow nine day later locomotor activity measured response single low dose amphetamine mgkg animal experienced cyclic sucrose chow hyperactive response amphetamine compared four control group libitum sucrose chow followed amphetamine injection cyclic chow followed amphetamine injection libitum chow amphetamine cyclic sucrose chow saline injection result suggest diet comprised alternating deprivation access sugar solution chow produce bingeing sugar lead long lasting state increased sensitivity amphetamine possibly due lasting alteration dopamine system;diet promoting sugar dependency cause behavioral crosssensitization low dose amphetamine previous research laboratory shown diet intermittent excessive sugar consumption produce state neurochemical behavioral similarity drug dependency present study examined whether female rat various regimen sugar access would show behavioral crosssensitization low dose amphetamine min baseline measure locomotor activity day animal maintained cyclic diet deprivation followed access sucrose solution chow pellet access starting onset dark period day locomotor activity measured min beginning day sugar access beginning day rat maintained libitum chow nine day later locomotor activity measured response single low dose amphetamine mgkg animal experienced cyclic sucrose chow hyperactive response amphetamine compared four control group libitum sucrose chow followed amphetamine injection cyclic chow followed amphetamine injection libitum chow amphetamine cyclic sucrose chow saline injection result suggest diet comprised alternating deprivation access sugar solution chow produce bingeing sugar lead long lasting state increased sensitivity amphetamine possibly due lasting alteration dopamine system;neurological;cardiovascular|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Linkage relationships of the apolipoprotein C1 gene and a cytochrome P450 gene (CYP2A) to myotonic dystrophy.;We have studied the genetic linkage of two markers , the apolipoprotein C1 ( APOC1 ) gene and a cytochrome P450 ( CYP2A ) gene , in relation to the gene for myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) . A peak lod score of 9 . 29 at 2 cM was observed for APOC1-DM , with a lod score of 8 . 55 at 4 cM for CYP2A-DM . These two markers also show close linkage to each other ( theta max = 0 . 05 , Zmax = 9 . 09 ) . From examination of the genotypes of the recombinant individuals , CYP2A appears to map proximal to DM because in one recombinant individual CYP2A , APOC2 and CKMM had all recombined with DM . Evidence from another CYP2A-DM recombinant individual places CYP2A proximal to APOC2 and CKMM . Localisation of CYP2A on a panel of somatic cell hybrids also suggests that it is proximal to DM and APOC2 / C1 / E gene cluster .;neurological;linkage relationship apolipoprotein gene cytochrome gene cypa myotonic dystrophy;studied genetic linkage two marker apolipoprotein apoc gene cytochrome cypa gene relation gene myotonic dystrophy peak lod score observed apocdm lod score cypadm two marker also show close linkage theta max zmax examination genotype recombinant individual cypa appears map proximal one recombinant individual cypa apoc ckmm recombined evidence another cypadm recombinant individual place cypa proximal apoc ckmm localisation cypa panel somatic cell hybrid also suggests proximal apoc gene cluster;linkage relationship apolipoprotein gene cytochrome gene cypa myotonic dystrophy studied genetic linkage two marker apolipoprotein apoc gene cytochrome cypa gene relation gene myotonic dystrophy peak lod score observed apocdm lod score cypadm two marker also show close linkage theta max zmax examination genotype recombinant individual cypa appears map proximal one recombinant individual cypa apoc ckmm recombined evidence another cypadm recombinant individual place cypa proximal apoc ckmm localisation cypa panel somatic cell hybrid also suggests proximal apoc gene cluster;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Nelarabine neurotoxicity with concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy: Case report and review of literature.;Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is reported. A 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted for relapsed disease. She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant. She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement. She was re-induced with nelarabine 1500 mg/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 with 1 dose of IT cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. At the time of treatment, she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). She tolerated therapy well, entered a complete remission, and recovered her renal function. She received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional IT prophylaxis one month later. A week after this second cycle, she noted numbness in her lower extremities. Predominantly sensory, though also motor and autonomic, peripheral neuropathy started in her feet, ascended proximally to the mid-thoracic region, and eventually included her distal upper extremities. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine demonstrated changes from C2 to C6 consistent with subacute combined degeneration. Nelarabine was felt to be the cause of her symptoms. Her neuropathy stabilized and showed slight improvement and ultimately received an unrelated, reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant while in complete remission, but relapsed disease 10 weeks later. She is currently being treated with best supportive care.

Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low-risk patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.;"BACKGROUND: Most patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with cocaine-associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a ""rule out acute coronary syndrome"" protocol, often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge. In patients without cocaine use, coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged. It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine-associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia. We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low-risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain (self-reported or positive urine test). Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED (without serial markers) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements. Patients with negative coronary CTA (maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged. The main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Patients had a mean age of 45.6 +/- 6.6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male. Seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85% had a TIMI score <2. Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED, 18 of whom were discharged following CTA (90%). Thirty-nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following CTA (95%). Six patients had coronary stenosis >or=50%. During the 30-day follow-up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event (0%; 95% CI, 0-6.1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction (0%; 95% CI, 0-6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non-ischemic ECG, and a TIMI risk score <2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30-day adverse events.";cardiovascular;coronary computerized tomography angiography rapid discharge lowrisk patient cocaineassociated chest pain;background patient presenting emergency department ed cocaineassociated chest pain admitted least hour receive rule acute coronary syndrome protocol often noninvasive testing prior discharge patient without cocaine use coronary computerized tomography angiography cta shown useful identifying group patient low risk cardiac event safely discharged unclear whether coronary cta strategy would efficacious cocaineassociated chest pain coronary vasospasm may account ischemia studied whether negative coronary cta patient cocaineassociated chest pain could identify subset safe discharge method prospectively evaluated safety coronary cta lowrisk patient presented cocaineassociated chest pain selfreported positive urine test consecutive patient received either immediate coronary cta without serial marker underwent coronary cta brief observation period serial cardiac marker measurement patient negative coronary cta maximal stenosis less discharged main outcome day cardiovascular death myocardial infarction result total patient cocaineassociated chest pain evaluated patient mean age yr black male seventynine percent normal nonspecific ecg timi score twenty patient received coronary cta immediately discharged following cta thirtynine received coronary cta brief observation period discharged home following cta six patient coronary stenosis day followup period patient died cardiovascular event patient sustained nonfatal myocardial infarction conclusion although cocaineassociated myocardial ischemia result coronary vasoconstriction patient cocaine associated chest pain nonischemic ecg timi risk score may safely discharged negative coronary cta low risk day adverse event;coronary computerized tomography angiography rapid discharge lowrisk patient cocaineassociated chest pain background patient presenting emergency department ed cocaineassociated chest pain admitted least hour receive rule acute coronary syndrome protocol often noninvasive testing prior discharge patient without cocaine use coronary computerized tomography angiography cta shown useful identifying group patient low risk cardiac event safely discharged unclear whether coronary cta strategy would efficacious cocaineassociated chest pain coronary vasospasm may account ischemia studied whether negative coronary cta patient cocaineassociated chest pain could identify subset safe discharge method prospectively evaluated safety coronary cta lowrisk patient presented cocaineassociated chest pain selfreported positive urine test consecutive patient received either immediate coronary cta without serial marker underwent coronary cta brief observation period serial cardiac marker measurement patient negative coronary cta maximal stenosis less discharged main outcome day cardiovascular death myocardial infarction result total patient cocaineassociated chest pain evaluated patient mean age yr black male seventynine percent normal nonspecific ecg timi score twenty patient received coronary cta immediately discharged following cta thirtynine received coronary cta brief observation period discharged home following cta six patient coronary stenosis day followup period patient died cardiovascular event patient sustained nonfatal myocardial infarction conclusion although cocaineassociated myocardial ischemia result coronary vasoconstriction patient cocaine associated chest pain nonischemic ecg timi risk score may safely discharged negative coronary cta low risk day adverse event;cardiovascular;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Canavan disease: genomic organization and localization of human ASPA to 17p13-ter and conservation of the ASPA gene during evolution.;Canavan disease , or spongy degeneration of the brain , is a severe leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase ( ASPA ) . Recently , a missense mutation was identified in human ASPA coding sequence from patients with Canavan disease . The human ASPA gene has been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome . Human aspartoacylase is coded by six exons intervened by five introns . The exons vary from 94 ( exon III ) to 514 ( exon VI ) bases . The exon / intron splice junction sites follow the gt / ag consensus sequence rule . Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human / mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines localized ASPA to human chromosome 17 . The human ASPA locus was further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization . The bovine aspa gene has also been cloned , and its exon / intron organization is identical to that of the human gene . The 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator ATG codon in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77 % identical . Human ASPA coding sequences cross-hybridize with genomic DNA from yeast , chicken , rabbit , cow , dog , mouse , rat , and monkey . The specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution . It should now be possible to identify mutations in the noncoding genomic sequences that lead to Canavan disease and to study the regulation of ASPA . .;neurological;canavan disease genomic organization localization human aspa pter conservation aspa gene evolution;canavan disease spongy degeneration brain severe leukodystrophy caused deficiency aspartoacylase aspa recently missense mutation identified human aspa coding sequence patient canavan disease human aspa gene cloned found span genome human aspartoacylase coded six exon intervened five intron exon vary exon iii exon base exon intron splice junction site follow consensus sequence rule southern blot analysis genomic dna human mouse somatic cell hybrid cell line localized aspa human chromosome human aspa locus mapped pter region fluorescence situ hybridization bovine aspa gene also cloned exon intron organization identical human gene base sequence upstream initiator atg codon human gene bovine gene identical human aspa coding sequence crosshybridize genomic dna yeast chicken rabbit cow dog mouse rat monkey specificity crossspecies hybridization coding sequence suggests aspartoacylase conserved evolution possible identify mutation noncoding genomic sequence lead canavan disease study regulation aspa;canavan disease genomic organization localization human aspa pter conservation aspa gene evolution canavan disease spongy degeneration brain severe leukodystrophy caused deficiency aspartoacylase aspa recently missense mutation identified human aspa coding sequence patient canavan disease human aspa gene cloned found span genome human aspartoacylase coded six exon intervened five intron exon vary exon iii exon base exon intron splice junction site follow consensus sequence rule southern blot analysis genomic dna human mouse somatic cell hybrid cell line localized aspa human chromosome human aspa locus mapped pter region fluorescence situ hybridization bovine aspa gene also cloned exon intron organization identical human gene base sequence upstream initiator atg codon human gene bovine gene identical human aspa coding sequence crosshybridize genomic dna yeast chicken rabbit cow dog mouse rat monkey specificity crossspecies hybridization coding sequence suggests aspartoacylase conserved evolution possible identify mutation noncoding genomic sequence lead canavan disease study regulation aspa;neurological;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine: comparison with exercise-induced ischemia.;The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease. Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise. Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina. However, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.;neurological|cardiovascular;mechanism myocardial ischemia induced epinephrine comparison exerciseinduced ischemia;role epinephrine eliciting myocardial ischemia examined patient coronary artery disease objective sign ischemia factor increasing myocardial oxygen consumption compared epinephrine infusion supine bicycle exercise epinephrine exercise produced myocardial ischemia evidenced segment depression angina however mechanism myocardial ischemia induced epinephrine significantly different exercise exerciseinduced myocardial ischemia marked predominantly increased heart rate ratepressure product minor contribution enddiastolic volume epinephrineinduced ischemia characterized marked increase contractility less pronounced increase heart rate ratepressure product finding indicate ischemia produced epinephrine may occur state emotional distress mechanism distinct due physical exertion;mechanism myocardial ischemia induced epinephrine comparison exerciseinduced ischemia role epinephrine eliciting myocardial ischemia examined patient coronary artery disease objective sign ischemia factor increasing myocardial oxygen consumption compared epinephrine infusion supine bicycle exercise epinephrine exercise produced myocardial ischemia evidenced segment depression angina however mechanism myocardial ischemia induced epinephrine significantly different exercise exerciseinduced myocardial ischemia marked predominantly increased heart rate ratepressure product minor contribution enddiastolic volume epinephrineinduced ischemia characterized marked increase contractility less pronounced increase heart rate ratepressure product finding indicate ischemia produced epinephrine may occur state emotional distress mechanism distinct due physical exertion;neurological|cardiovascular;none;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine-induced amnesia.;The effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase, scopolamine-induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and E-2020. NIK-247, tacrine and E-2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively). In addition, NIK-247 and tacrine, but not E-2020, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum. All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of NIK-247 on AChE was reversible. All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task.

Acute liver failure with concurrent bupropion and carbimazole therapy.;OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal liver failure possibly associated with concurrent use of bupropion and carbimazole. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old Chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years. He received a 10-day course of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation. He developed acute liver failure with rapid deterioration of renal function. Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug-induced acute liver injury. His condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy. Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms. The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible, based on the Naranjo probability scale. DISCUSSION: Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion, this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute liver insult induced by bupropion given concurrently with other hepatotoxic drugs.;neurological|hepatorenal;acute liver failure concurrent bupropion carbimazole therapy;objective report case fatal liver failure possibly associated concurrent use bupropion carbimazole case summary yearold chinese man history hyperthyroidism treated carbimazole propranolol past year received day course bupropion aid smoking cessation week prior presentation developed acute liver failure rapid deterioration renal function liver biopsy showed evidence nonspecific druginduced acute liver injury condition complicated sepsis coagulopathy death resulted day onset symptom likelihood bupropion induced hepatotoxicity patient possible based naranjo probability scale discussion although increasing evidence hepatotoxicity induced bupropion first case fatality could resulted acute liver failure patient receiving bupropion concomitant treatment carbimazole conclusion clinician aware possibility acute liver insult induced bupropion given concurrently hepatotoxic drug;acute liver failure concurrent bupropion carbimazole therapy objective report case fatal liver failure possibly associated concurrent use bupropion carbimazole case summary yearold chinese man history hyperthyroidism treated carbimazole propranolol past year received day course bupropion aid smoking cessation week prior presentation developed acute liver failure rapid deterioration renal function liver biopsy showed evidence nonspecific druginduced acute liver injury condition complicated sepsis coagulopathy death resulted day onset symptom likelihood bupropion induced hepatotoxicity patient possible based naranjo probability scale discussion although increasing evidence hepatotoxicity induced bupropion first case fatality could resulted acute liver failure patient receiving bupropion concomitant treatment carbimazole conclusion clinician aware possibility acute liver insult induced bupropion given concurrently hepatotoxic drug;neurological|hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Linkage analysis of 26 Canadian breast and breast-ovarian cancer families.;We have examined 26 Canadian families with hereditary breast or ovarian cancer for linkage to markers flanking the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q12-q21 . Of the 15 families that contain cases of ovarian cancer , 94 % were estimated to be linked to BRCA1 . In contrast , there was no overall evidence of linkage in the group of 10 families with breast cancer without ovarian cancer . A genetic recombinant in a breast-ovarian cancer family indicates a placement of BRCA1 telomeric to D17S776 , and helps to define the region of assignment of the cancer susceptibility gene .

Fluconazole associated agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia.;"CASE: We describe a second case of fluconazole associated agranulocytosis with thrombocytopenia and recovery upon discontinuation of therapy. The patient began to have changes in white blood cells and platelets within 48 h of administration of fluconazole and began to recover with 48 h of discontinuation. This case highlights that drug-induced blood dyscrasias can occur unexpectedly as a result of treatment with a commonly used drug thought to be ""safe"". CONCLUSION: According to Naranjo's algorithm the likelihood that our patient's agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia occurred as a result of therapy with fluconazole is probable, with a total of six points.

Efficacy of everolimus (RAD001) in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors.;"BACKGROUND: Treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RAD001, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), has shown phase I efficacy in NSCLC. METHODS: Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients, with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens, one platinum based (stratum 1) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2), received RAD001 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective was overall response rate (ORR). Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct mutation sequencing. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum. ORR was 4.7% (7.1% stratum 1; 2.3% stratum 2). Overall disease control rate was 47.1%. Median progression-free survivals (PFSs) were 2.6 (stratum 1) and 2.7 months (stratum 2). Common > or =grade 3 events were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1/2, occurred in 25%. Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT (pAKT) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS. CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 10 mg/day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC.

Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during fluorouracil therapy: a prospective study.;"Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion. We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5-FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes. Patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before 5-FU infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during 5-FU infusion. Anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-FU infusion). However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before 5-FU infusion v 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P less than .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P less than .01). ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease. There were two cases of sudden death, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course. We conclude that 5-FU infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia, particularly among patients with coronary artery disease.

Mutations of the cathepsin C gene are responsible for Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.;Papillon-Lefevre syndrome ( PLS ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis that results in the premature loss of the primary and secondary dentitions . A major gene locus for PLS has been mapped to a 2 . 8 cM interval on chromosome 11q14 . Correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ESTs and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene ( CTSC ) . The CTSC message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes , macrophages , and their precursors . By RT-PCR , we found CTSC is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by PLS , including the palms , soles , knees , and oral keratinised gingiva . The 4 . 7 kb CTSC gene consists of two exons . Sequence analysis of CTSC from subjects affected with PLS from five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations . An exon 1 nonsense mutation ( 856C-- > T ) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286 . Three exon 2 mutations were identified , including a single nucleotide deletion ( 2692delA ) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon , a 2 bp deletion ( 2673-2674delCT ) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343 , and a G-- > A substitution in codon 429 ( 2931G-- > A ) introducing a premature termination codon . All PLS patients were homozygous for cathepsin C mutations inherited from a common ancestor . Parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin C mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe early onset periodontitis characteristic of PLS . A more complete understanding of the functional physiology of cathepsin C carries significant implications for understanding normal and abnormal skin development and periodontal disease susceptibility;neurological;mutation cathepsin gene responsible papillonlefevre syndrome;papillonlefevre syndrome pls autosomal recessive disorder characterised palmoplantar hyperkeratosis severe early onset periodontitis result premature loss primary secondary dentition major gene locus pls mapped interval chromosome correlation physical genetic map interval indicate includes least est six known gene including lysosomal protease cathepsin gene ctsc ctsc message expressed high level variety immune cell including polymorphonuclear leucocyte macrophage precursor rtpcr found ctsc also expressed epithelial region commonly affected pls including palm sol knee oral keratinised gingiva ctsc gene consists two exon sequence analysis ctsc subject affected pls five consanguineous turkish family identified four different mutation exon nonsense mutation introduces premature stop codon amino acid three exon mutation identified including single nucleotide deletion dela codon introducing frameshift premature termination codon deletion delct result introduction stop codon amino acid substitution codon introducing premature termination codon pls patient homozygous cathepsin mutation inherited common ancestor parent sib heterozygous cathepsin mutation show either palmoplantar hyperkeratosis severe early onset periodontitis characteristic pls complete understanding functional physiology cathepsin carry significant implication understanding normal abnormal skin development periodontal disease susceptibility;mutation cathepsin gene responsible papillonlefevre syndrome papillonlefevre syndrome pls autosomal recessive disorder characterised palmoplantar hyperkeratosis severe early onset periodontitis result premature loss primary secondary dentition major gene locus pls mapped interval chromosome correlation physical genetic map interval indicate includes least est six known gene including lysosomal protease cathepsin gene ctsc ctsc message expressed high level variety immune cell including polymorphonuclear leucocyte macrophage precursor rtpcr found ctsc also expressed epithelial region commonly affected pls including palm sol knee oral keratinised gingiva ctsc gene consists two exon sequence analysis ctsc subject affected pls five consanguineous turkish family identified four different mutation exon nonsense mutation introduces premature stop codon amino acid three exon mutation identified including single nucleotide deletion dela codon introducing frameshift premature termination codon deletion delct result introduction stop codon amino acid substitution codon introducing premature termination codon pls patient homozygous cathepsin mutation inherited common ancestor parent sib heterozygous cathepsin mutation show either palmoplantar hyperkeratosis severe early onset periodontitis characteristic pls complete understanding functional physiology cathepsin carry significant implication understanding normal abnormal skin development periodontal disease susceptibility;neurological;cardiovascular|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Genomic organization of the adrenoleukodystrophy gene.;"Adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) , the most frequent peroxisomal disorder , is a severe neurodegenerative disease associated with an impairment of very long chain fatty acids beta-oxidation . We have recently identified by positional cloning the gene responsible for ALD , located in Xq28 . It encodes a new member of the "" ABC "" superfamily of membrane-associated transporters that shows , in particular , significant homology to the 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein ( PMP70 ) . We report here a detailed characterization of the ALD gene structure . It extends over 21 kb and consists of 10 exons . To facilitate the detection of mutations in ALD patients , we have determined the intronic sequences flanking the exons as well as the sequence of the 3 untranslated region and of the immediate 5 promoter region . Sequences present in distal exons cross-hybridize strongly to additional sequences in the human genome . The ALD gene has been positioned on a pulsed-field map between DXS15 and the L1CAM gene , about 650 kb upstream from the color pigment genes . The frequent occurrence of color vision anomalies observed in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy ( the adult onset form of ALD ) thus does not represent a contiguous gene syndrome but a secondary manifestation of ALD . .";neurological;genomic organization adrenoleukodystrophy gene;adrenoleukodystrophy ald frequent peroxisomal disorder severe neurodegenerative disease associated impairment long chain fatty acid betaoxidation recently identified positional cloning gene responsible ald located encodes new member abc superfamily membraneassociated transporter show particular significant homology kda peroxisomal membrane protein pmp report detailed characterization ald gene structure extends consists exon facilitate detection mutation ald patient determined intronic sequence flanking exon well sequence untranslated region immediate promoter region sequence present distal exon crosshybridize strongly additional sequence human genome ald gene positioned pulsedfield map dxs lcam gene upstream color pigment gene frequent occurrence color vision anomaly observed patient adrenomyeloneuropathy adult onset form ald thus represent contiguous gene syndrome secondary manifestation ald;genomic organization adrenoleukodystrophy gene adrenoleukodystrophy ald frequent peroxisomal disorder severe neurodegenerative disease associated impairment long chain fatty acid betaoxidation recently identified positional cloning gene responsible ald located encodes new member abc superfamily membraneassociated transporter show particular significant homology kda peroxisomal membrane protein pmp report detailed characterization ald gene structure extends consists exon facilitate detection mutation ald patient determined intronic sequence flanking exon well sequence untranslated region immediate promoter region sequence present distal exon crosshybridize strongly additional sequence human genome ald gene positioned pulsedfield map dxs lcam gene upstream color pigment gene frequent occurrence color vision anomaly observed patient adrenomyeloneuropathy adult onset form ald thus represent contiguous gene syndrome secondary manifestation ald;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Genetically determined low C4: a predisposing factor to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.;Of 26 patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) starting in childhood 18 ( 69 % ) had low C4 and 5 ( 19 % ) had low C3 serum levels . Impaired hepatic synthesis and immune-consumption were unlikely since transferrin levels were normal in all patients , albumin levels were persistently low in only 3 , and only 3 had raised levels of activation fragment C3d . C4d was normal in all patients studied . In the families of 12 probands with low C4 , 7 parents had low C4 and 2 had levels which were at the lower limit of normal . 5 of 10 siblings from 5 families had low C4 . These results suggest that low C4 levels in CAH are genetically determined . C4 phenotyping in 20 patients and in 26 parents showed that 90 % and 81 % , respectively , had null allotypes at either the C4A or C4B locus compared with 59 % in controls , indicating that defective expression of structural genes may contribute to the observed C4 deficiency . .;hepatorenal;genetically determined low predisposing factor autoimmune chronic active hepatitis;patient autoimmune chronic active hepatitis cah starting childhood low low serum level impaired hepatic synthesis immuneconsumption unlikely since transferrin level normal patient albumin level persistently low raised level activation fragment normal patient studied family probands low parent low level lower limit normal sibling family low result suggest low level cah genetically determined phenotyping patient parent showed respectively null allotypes either locus compared control indicating defective expression structural gene may contribute observed deficiency;genetically determined low predisposing factor autoimmune chronic active hepatitis patient autoimmune chronic active hepatitis cah starting childhood low low serum level impaired hepatic synthesis immuneconsumption unlikely since transferrin level normal patient albumin level persistently low raised level activation fragment normal patient studied family probands low parent low level lower limit normal sibling family low result suggest low level cah genetically determined phenotyping patient parent showed respectively null allotypes either locus compared control indicating defective expression structural gene may contribute observed deficiency;hepatorenal;none;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer--a highly aggressive disease: analysis of 12 cases.;PURPOSE: We gained knowledge of the etiology, treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed. RESULTS: All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma. Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease. Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months. The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease. However, long-term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease, even when noninvasive.;oncological;cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancera highly aggressive disease analysis case;purpose gained knowledge etiology treatment prevention cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer material method medical record men woman mean age year cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer reviewed result tumor grade transitional cell carcinoma patient initially treated endoscopic resection alone alive without disease patient underwent early cystectomy alive month remaining patient extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy palliation died month later conclusion cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor aggressive disease however longterm survival possible radical cystectomy performed bladder tumor sign invasion recurrent high grade disease even noninvasive;cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancera highly aggressive disease analysis case purpose gained knowledge etiology treatment prevention cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer material method medical record men woman mean age year cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer reviewed result tumor grade transitional cell carcinoma patient initially treated endoscopic resection alone alive without disease patient underwent early cystectomy alive month remaining patient extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy palliation died month later conclusion cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor aggressive disease however longterm survival possible radical cystectomy performed bladder tumor sign invasion recurrent high grade disease even noninvasive;oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Genotype-phenotype analysis in X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and identification of a missense mutation associated with a milder phenotype.;Direct sequencing of the emerin gene in 22 families with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EMD ) revealed mutations in 21 ( 95 % ) , confirming that emerin mutations can be identified in the majority of families with X-linked EMD . Most emerin mutations result in absence of the protein . In this study three mutations ( a missense mutation Pro183Thr and two in-frame deletions removing residues 95-99 and 236-241 , respectively ) were unusual in being associated with expression of mutant protein . The phenotype in these families was compared in detail with the clinical features in cases with typical null mutations . For the in-frame deletions there were no significant differences . In the family with the missense mutation the phenotype was milder . Age at onset was later for first symptoms and for development of ankle contractures and muscle weakness . These findings have diagnostic implications as well as pointing to functionally important regions of the emerin protein . .;neurological;genotypephenotype analysis xlinked emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy identification missense mutation associated milder phenotype;direct sequencing emerin gene family emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy emd revealed mutation confirming emerin mutation identified majority family xlinked emd emerin mutation result absence protein study three mutation missense mutation prothr two inframe deletion removing residue respectively unusual associated expression mutant protein phenotype family compared detail clinical feature case typical null mutation inframe deletion significant difference family missense mutation phenotype milder age onset later first symptom development ankle contracture muscle weakness finding diagnostic implication well pointing functionally important region emerin protein;genotypephenotype analysis xlinked emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy identification missense mutation associated milder phenotype direct sequencing emerin gene family emerydreifuss muscular dystrophy emd revealed mutation confirming emerin mutation identified majority family xlinked emd emerin mutation result absence protein study three mutation missense mutation prothr two inframe deletion removing residue respectively unusual associated expression mutant protein phenotype family compared detail clinical feature case typical null mutation inframe deletion significant difference family missense mutation phenotype milder age onset later first symptom development ankle contracture muscle weakness finding diagnostic implication well pointing functionally important region emerin protein;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis.;Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.;hepatorenal;different lobular distribution altered hepatocyte tight junction rat model intrahepatic extrahepatic cholestasis;hepatocyte tight junction tjs intercellular barrier sinusoidal canalicular space play key role bile formation although hepatocyte tjs impaired cholestasis attempt localize precise site hepatocyte damage freezefracture electron microscopy produced limited information recently several tjassociated protein like identified characterized immunolocalization appears closely correlate paracellular permeability used rat model intrahepatic cholestasis ethinyl estradiol treatment extrahepatic cholestasis bile duct ligation bdl precisely determine site damage alteration hepatocyte tjs assessed doubleimmunolabeling using confocal laser scanning microscope control rat immunostaining colocalized outline bile canaliculus continuous fashion contrast immunostaining discontinuous outlining bile canaliculus bdl immunostaining decreased predominantly appeared discrete signal submembranous cytoplasm periportal hepatocytes bdl treatment change immunostaining similar seen periportal hepatocytes bdl distributed diffusely throughout lobule study first demonstrate impairment hepatocyte tjs occurs heterogenously liver lobule bdl suggests bdl treatment produce different lobular distribution increased paracellular permeability;different lobular distribution altered hepatocyte tight junction rat model intrahepatic extrahepatic cholestasis hepatocyte tight junction tjs intercellular barrier sinusoidal canalicular space play key role bile formation although hepatocyte tjs impaired cholestasis attempt localize precise site hepatocyte damage freezefracture electron microscopy produced limited information recently several tjassociated protein like identified characterized immunolocalization appears closely correlate paracellular permeability used rat model intrahepatic cholestasis ethinyl estradiol treatment extrahepatic cholestasis bile duct ligation bdl precisely determine site damage alteration hepatocyte tjs assessed doubleimmunolabeling using confocal laser scanning microscope control rat immunostaining colocalized outline bile canaliculus continuous fashion contrast immunostaining discontinuous outlining bile canaliculus bdl immunostaining decreased predominantly appeared discrete signal submembranous cytoplasm periportal hepatocytes bdl treatment change immunostaining similar seen periportal hepatocytes bdl distributed diffusely throughout lobule study first demonstrate impairment hepatocyte tjs occurs heterogenously liver lobule bdl suggests bdl treatment produce different lobular distribution increased paracellular permeability;hepatorenal;hepatorenal|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Paraplegia following intrathecal methotrexate: report of a case and review of the literature.;"A patient who developed paraplegia following the intrathecal instillation of methotrexate is discribed. The ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are reviewed. The following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication: abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of central nervous system leukemia, and epidural cerebrospinal leakage; elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high methotrexate doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults; the presence of neurotoxic preservatives in commercially available methotrexate preparations and diluents; and the use of methotrexate diluents of unphysiologic pH, ionic content and osmolarity. The role of methotrexate contaminants, local folate deficiency, and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal methotrexate toxicity is unclear. The incidence of neurotoxicity may be reduced by employing lower doses of methotrexate in the presence of central nervous system leukemia, in older children and adults, and in the presence of epidural leakage. Only preservative-free methotrexate in Elliott's B Solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg/ml should be used for intrathecal administration. Periodic monitoring of cerebruspinal fluid methotrexate levels may be predictive of the development of serious neurotoxicity.";neurological|oncological;paraplegia following intrathecal methotrexate report case review literature;patient developed paraplegia following intrathecal instillation methotrexate discribed ten previously reported case unusual complication reviewed following factor appear predispose development complication abnormal cerebrospinal dynamic related presence central nervous system leukemia epidural cerebrospinal leakage elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamic inappropriately high methotrexate dos based body surface area calculation older child adult presence neurotoxic preservative commercially available methotrexate preparation diluent use methotrexate diluent unphysiologic ionic content osmolarity role methotrexate contaminant local folate deficiency cranial irradiation pathogenesis intrathecal methotrexate toxicity unclear incidence neurotoxicity may reduced employing lower dos methotrexate presence central nervous system leukemia older child adult presence epidural leakage preservativefree methotrexate elliotts solution concentration mgml used intrathecal administration periodic monitoring cerebruspinal fluid methotrexate level may predictive development serious neurotoxicity;paraplegia following intrathecal methotrexate report case review literature patient developed paraplegia following intrathecal instillation methotrexate discribed ten previously reported case unusual complication reviewed following factor appear predispose development complication abnormal cerebrospinal dynamic related presence central nervous system leukemia epidural cerebrospinal leakage elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamic inappropriately high methotrexate dos based body surface area calculation older child adult presence neurotoxic preservative commercially available methotrexate preparation diluent use methotrexate diluent unphysiologic ionic content osmolarity role methotrexate contaminant local folate deficiency cranial irradiation pathogenesis intrathecal methotrexate toxicity unclear incidence neurotoxicity may reduced employing lower dos methotrexate presence central nervous system leukemia older child adult presence epidural leakage preservativefree methotrexate elliotts solution concentration mgml used intrathecal administration periodic monitoring cerebruspinal fluid methotrexate level may predictive development serious neurotoxicity;neurological|oncological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Effect of D-Glucarates on basic antibiotic-induced renal damage in rats.;Dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only. Oral administration of 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin-dextran. The protective effect was prevalent among D-glucarates, and also to other saccharic acid, hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids, although to a lesser degree, but not to a hexaaldose, sugar alcohols, substances inthe TCA cycle and other acidic compounds. D-Glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis. Dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of D-Glucarates. With a D-glucarate of a fixed size of dose, approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics. D-Glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it. Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides. The reduction effect of D-glucarates against nephrotoxicity of basic antibiotics was discussed.;hepatorenal;effect dglucarates basic antibioticinduced renal damage rat;dehydrated rat regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection aminoglycoside antibiotic combined dextran antibiotic oral administration dioacetyldglucarodilactone protected rat renal failure induced kanamycindextran protective effect prevalent among dglucarates also saccharic acid hexauronic acid hexaaldonic acid although lesser degree hexaaldose sugar alcohol substance inthe tca cycle acidic compound dglucarates effective renal damage induced peptide antibiotic well various aminoglycoside antibitocis doseresponses observed protective effect dglucarates dglucarate fixed size dose approximately degree protection obtained renal damage induced different basic antibiotic despite large disparity administration dos different antibiotic dglucarates ability prevent renal damage cure rat excreted acidic urine spared renal lesion monosaccharide reduction effect dglucarates nephrotoxicity basic antibiotic discussed;effect dglucarates basic antibioticinduced renal damage rat dehydrated rat regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection aminoglycoside antibiotic combined dextran antibiotic oral administration dioacetyldglucarodilactone protected rat renal failure induced kanamycindextran protective effect prevalent among dglucarates also saccharic acid hexauronic acid hexaaldonic acid although lesser degree hexaaldose sugar alcohol substance inthe tca cycle acidic compound dglucarates effective renal damage induced peptide antibiotic well various aminoglycoside antibitocis doseresponses observed protective effect dglucarates dglucarate fixed size dose approximately degree protection obtained renal damage induced different basic antibiotic despite large disparity administration dos different antibiotic dglucarates ability prevent renal damage cure rat excreted acidic urine spared renal lesion monosaccharide reduction effect dglucarates nephrotoxicity basic antibiotic discussed;hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non-selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in CRL:(WI)WUBR Wistar rats--DFU and piroxicam study.;"BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy. Unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam) and selective (DFU; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furanon) COX-2 inhibitors. METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for DFU. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams. Prenatal exposure to selective COX-2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non-selective drugs and historic control.";neurological|hepatorenal;comparison developmental toxicity selective nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor crlwiwubr wistar ratsdfu piroxicam study;background cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor one often ingested drug pregnancy unlike general toxicity data prenatal toxic effect extensively studied aim experiment evaluate developmental toxicity nonselective piroxicam selective dfu dimethylfluorophenylmethylsulphonyl phenylhfuranon cox inhibitor method drug separately orally daily dosed pregnant rat day gdplug day dos set mgkg piroxicam mgkg dfu fetus delivered routinely examined comprehensive clinical developmental measurement done pooled statistical analysis ventricular septal vsd midline defect performed rat fetus exposed piroxicam selective nonselective cox inhibitor based present historic data result maternal toxicity intrauterine growth retardation increase external skeletal variation found rat treated highest dose piroxicam decrease fetal length sign dfu developmental toxicity observed pup exposed highest compound dose lack teratogenicity found piroxicam dfuexposed group prenatal exposure nonselective cox inhibitor increase risk vsd compared historic control selective cox inhibitor conclusion selective nonselective cox inhibitor toxic rat fetus administered highest dose unlike dfu piroxicam also highly toxic dam prenatal exposure selective cox inhibitor increase risk ventricular septal midline defect rat compared nonselective drug historic control;comparison developmental toxicity selective nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor crlwiwubr wistar ratsdfu piroxicam study background cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor one often ingested drug pregnancy unlike general toxicity data prenatal toxic effect extensively studied aim experiment evaluate developmental toxicity nonselective piroxicam selective dfu dimethylfluorophenylmethylsulphonyl phenylhfuranon cox inhibitor method drug separately orally daily dosed pregnant rat day gdplug day dos set mgkg piroxicam mgkg dfu fetus delivered routinely examined comprehensive clinical developmental measurement done pooled statistical analysis ventricular septal vsd midline defect performed rat fetus exposed piroxicam selective nonselective cox inhibitor based present historic data result maternal toxicity intrauterine growth retardation increase external skeletal variation found rat treated highest dose piroxicam decrease fetal length sign dfu developmental toxicity observed pup exposed highest compound dose lack teratogenicity found piroxicam dfuexposed group prenatal exposure nonselective cox inhibitor increase risk vsd compared historic control selective cox inhibitor conclusion selective nonselective cox inhibitor toxic rat fetus administered highest dose unlike dfu piroxicam also highly toxic dam prenatal exposure selective cox inhibitor increase risk ventricular septal midline defect rat compared nonselective drug historic control;neurological|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Carvedilol protects against doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.;Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin. Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties, protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity. Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg sc/week), carvedilol (1 mg/kg ip/week), or the combination of the two drugs. Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats. Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity and the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin-treated rats. Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity. Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver. Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin. Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria. It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long-term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;carvedilol protects doxorubicininduced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy;several cytopathic mechanism suggested mediate doselimiting cumulative irreversible cardiomyopathy caused doxorubicin recent evidence indicates oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction key factor pathogenic process objective investigation test hypothesis carvedilol nonselective betaadrenergic receptor antagonist potent antioxidant property protects cardiac hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated subchronic doxorubicin toxicity heart liver mitochondrion isolated rat treated week doxorubicin mgkg scweek carvedilol mgkg ipweek combination two drug heart mitochondrion isolated doxorubicintreated rat exhibited depressed rate state respiration versus natom ominmg protein lower respiratory control ratio rcr versus compared cardiac mitochondrion isolated salinetreated rat mitochondrial calciumloading capacity activity nadhdehydrogenase also suppressed cardiac mitochondrion doxorubicintreated rat doxorubicin treatment also caused decrease rcr liver mitochondrion versus control rat inhibition hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity coadministration carvedilol decreased extent cellular vacuolization cardiac myocytes prevented inhibitory effect doxorubicin mitochondrial respiration heart liver carvedilol also prevented decrease mitochondrial loading capacity inhibition respiratory complex heart mitochondrion caused doxorubicin carvedilol affect parameter measured heart liver mitochondrion concluded protection carvedilol structural functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage minimizing doselimiting mitochondrial dysfunction cardiomyopathy accompanies longterm doxorubicin therapy cancer patient;carvedilol protects doxorubicininduced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy several cytopathic mechanism suggested mediate doselimiting cumulative irreversible cardiomyopathy caused doxorubicin recent evidence indicates oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction key factor pathogenic process objective investigation test hypothesis carvedilol nonselective betaadrenergic receptor antagonist potent antioxidant property protects cardiac hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated subchronic doxorubicin toxicity heart liver mitochondrion isolated rat treated week doxorubicin mgkg scweek carvedilol mgkg ipweek combination two drug heart mitochondrion isolated doxorubicintreated rat exhibited depressed rate state respiration versus natom ominmg protein lower respiratory control ratio rcr versus compared cardiac mitochondrion isolated salinetreated rat mitochondrial calciumloading capacity activity nadhdehydrogenase also suppressed cardiac mitochondrion doxorubicintreated rat doxorubicin treatment also caused decrease rcr liver mitochondrion versus control rat inhibition hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity coadministration carvedilol decreased extent cellular vacuolization cardiac myocytes prevented inhibitory effect doxorubicin mitochondrial respiration heart liver carvedilol also prevented decrease mitochondrial loading capacity inhibition respiratory complex heart mitochondrion caused doxorubicin carvedilol affect parameter measured heart liver mitochondrion concluded protection carvedilol structural functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage minimizing doselimiting mitochondrial dysfunction cardiomyopathy accompanies longterm doxorubicin therapy cancer patient;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal|oncological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation.;We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection. The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Reported medications included bumetanide, pravastatin, and paroxetine. Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany. Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated, and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia. Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia. We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity. Laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors.;cardiovascular;severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation;report case severe citrate toxicity volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection donor yearold female firsttime apheresis platelet donor past medical history remarkable hypertension hyperlipidemia depression reported medication included bumetanide pravastatin paroxetine thirty minute start procedure donor noted tingling around mouth hand foot rapidly developed acute onset severe facial extremity tetany empirical treatment intravenous calcium gluconate initiated muscle contraction slowly subsided approximately minute event consistent severe reaction calcium chelation sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia upon additional retrospective analysis noted bumetanide loop diuretic may cause significant hypocalcemia conclude careful screening medication underlying condition predisposing hypocalcemia recommended help prevent severe reaction due citrate toxicity laboratory measurement preprocedure serum calcium level selected donor may identify case requiring heightened vigilance case also illustrates importance maintaining preparedness managing rare serious reaction volunteer apheresis blood donor;severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation report case severe citrate toxicity volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection donor yearold female firsttime apheresis platelet donor past medical history remarkable hypertension hyperlipidemia depression reported medication included bumetanide pravastatin paroxetine thirty minute start procedure donor noted tingling around mouth hand foot rapidly developed acute onset severe facial extremity tetany empirical treatment intravenous calcium gluconate initiated muscle contraction slowly subsided approximately minute event consistent severe reaction calcium chelation sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia upon additional retrospective analysis noted bumetanide loop diuretic may cause significant hypocalcemia conclude careful screening medication underlying condition predisposing hypocalcemia recommended help prevent severe reaction due citrate toxicity laboratory measurement preprocedure serum calcium level selected donor may identify case requiring heightened vigilance case also illustrates importance maintaining preparedness managing rare serious reaction volunteer apheresis blood donor;cardiovascular;cardiovascular|oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Mutations of the ATM gene detected in Japanese ataxia-telangiectasia patients: possible preponderance of the two founder mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5.;"The ATM ( A-T , mutated ) gene on human chromosome 11q22 . 3 has recently been identified as the gene responsible for the human recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) . In order to define the types of disease-causing ATM mutations in Japanese A-T patients as well as to look for possible mutational hotspots , reverse-transcribed RNA derived from ten patients belonging to eight unrelated Japanese A-T families was analyzed for mutations by the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method . As has been reported by others , mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation were also predominant in our mutants . Six different mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 alleles examined . Four were deletions involving a loss of a single exon  exon 7 , exon 16 , exon 33 or exon 35 . The others were minute deletions , 4649delA in exon 33 and 7883del5 in exon 55 . The mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 were found in more than two unrelated families ; 44 % ( 7 of 16 ) of the mutant alleles had one of the two mutations . The 4612del165 mutations in three different families were all ascribed to the same T-- > A substitution at the splice donor site in intron 33 . Microsatellite genotyping around the ATM locus also indicated that a common haplotype was shared by the mutant alleles in both mutations . This suggests that these two founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles .";neurological;mutation atm gene detected japanese ataxiatelangiectasia patient possible preponderance two founder mutation del del;atm mutated gene human chromosome recently identified gene responsible human recessive disease ataxiatelangiectasia order define type diseasecausing atm mutation japanese patient well look possible mutational hotspot reversetranscribed rna derived ten patient belonging eight unrelated japanese family analyzed mutation restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method reported others mutation lead exon skipping premature protein truncation also predominant mutant six different mutation identified allele examined four deletion involving loss single exon exon exon exon exon others minute deletion dela exon del exon mutation del del found two unrelated family mutant allele one two mutation del mutation three different family ascribed substitution splice donor site intron microsatellite genotyping around atm locus also indicated common haplotype shared mutant allele mutation suggests two founder mutation may predominant among japanese atm mutant allele;mutation atm gene detected japanese ataxiatelangiectasia patient possible preponderance two founder mutation del del atm mutated gene human chromosome recently identified gene responsible human recessive disease ataxiatelangiectasia order define type diseasecausing atm mutation japanese patient well look possible mutational hotspot reversetranscribed rna derived ten patient belonging eight unrelated japanese family analyzed mutation restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method reported others mutation lead exon skipping premature protein truncation also predominant mutant six different mutation identified allele examined four deletion involving loss single exon exon exon exon exon others minute deletion dela exon del exon mutation del del found two unrelated family mutant allele one two mutation del mutation three different family ascribed substitution splice donor site intron microsatellite genotyping around atm locus also indicated common haplotype shared mutant allele mutation suggests two founder mutation may predominant among japanese atm mutant allele;neurological;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Acute renal failure occurring during intravenous desferrioxamine therapy: recovery after haemodialysis.;A patient with transfusion-dependent thalassemia was undergoing home intravenous desferrioxamine (DFX) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the nightly subcutaneous therapy. Due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump, the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused renal insufficiency. Given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values, despite adequate medical treatment, a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephrotoxicity. From the results obtained, haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive acute renal failure caused by desferrioxamine.;neurological|hepatorenal;acute renal failure occurring intravenous desferrioxamine therapy recovery haemodialysis;patient transfusiondependent thalassemia undergoing home intravenous desferrioxamine dfx treatment mean totally implanted system poor compliance nightly subcutaneous therapy due accidental malfunctioning infusion pump patient inadvertently administered toxic dosage drug caused renal insufficiency given progressive deterioration symptom laboratory value despite adequate medical treatment decision made introduce haemodialytical therapy order remove drug therapy reduce nephrotoxicity result obtained haemodialysis therefore suggested useful therapy rare case progressive acute renal failure caused desferrioxamine;acute renal failure occurring intravenous desferrioxamine therapy recovery haemodialysis patient transfusiondependent thalassemia undergoing home intravenous desferrioxamine dfx treatment mean totally implanted system poor compliance nightly subcutaneous therapy due accidental malfunctioning infusion pump patient inadvertently administered toxic dosage drug caused renal insufficiency given progressive deterioration symptom laboratory value despite adequate medical treatment decision made introduce haemodialytical therapy order remove drug therapy reduce nephrotoxicity result obtained haemodialysis therefore suggested useful therapy rare case progressive acute renal failure caused desferrioxamine;neurological|hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II).;"OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed. The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data. Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale). RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema). Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg. Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.";cardiovascular;gastrointestinal tolerability etoricoxib rheumatoid arthritis patient result etoricoxib diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability effectiveness trial edgeii;objective randomised doubleblind study compare gastrointestinal tolerability safety efficacy etoricoxib diclofenac patient rheumatoid arthritis patient method total patient mean age year diagnosed enrolled received etoricoxib daily diclofenac twice daily use gastroprotective agent lowdose aspirin allowed prespecified primary end point consisted cumulative rate patient discontinuation due clinical laboratory adverse experience aes general safety also assessed including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data efficacy evaluated using patient global assessment disease status pgads point scale result mean maximum duration treatment month etoricoxib diclofenac group respectively cumulative discontinuation rate due aes significantly lower etoricoxib diclofenac event per patientyears respectively hazard ratio por incidence discontinuation hypertensionrelated oedemarelated aes significantly higher etoricoxib respectively compared diclofenac respectively hypertension oedema etoricoxib diclofenac treatment resulted similar efficacy pgads mean change baseline respectively conclusion etoricoxib demonstrated significantly lower risk discontinuing treatment due aes compared diclofenac discontinuation renovascular aes although less common discontinuation aes significantly higher etoricoxib;gastrointestinal tolerability etoricoxib rheumatoid arthritis patient result etoricoxib diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability effectiveness trial edgeii objective randomised doubleblind study compare gastrointestinal tolerability safety efficacy etoricoxib diclofenac patient rheumatoid arthritis patient method total patient mean age year diagnosed enrolled received etoricoxib daily diclofenac twice daily use gastroprotective agent lowdose aspirin allowed prespecified primary end point consisted cumulative rate patient discontinuation due clinical laboratory adverse experience aes general safety also assessed including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data efficacy evaluated using patient global assessment disease status pgads point scale result mean maximum duration treatment month etoricoxib diclofenac group respectively cumulative discontinuation rate due aes significantly lower etoricoxib diclofenac event per patientyears respectively hazard ratio por incidence discontinuation hypertensionrelated oedemarelated aes significantly higher etoricoxib respectively compared diclofenac respectively hypertension oedema etoricoxib diclofenac treatment resulted similar efficacy pgads mean change baseline respectively conclusion etoricoxib demonstrated significantly lower risk discontinuing treatment due aes compared diclofenac discontinuation renovascular aes although less common discontinuation aes significantly higher etoricoxib;cardiovascular;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Age at diagnosis as an indicator of eligibility for BRCA1 DNA testing in familial breast cancer.;We searched for criteria that could indicate breast cancer families with a high prior probability of being caused by the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility locus BRCA1 on chromosome 17 . To this end , we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families , including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer . We used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and / or ovarian cancer at any age . Significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years . An unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to BRCA1 , which could be due to a founder effect in the Dutch population . Given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that BRCA1 has been identified , we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and / or ovarian cancer will be offered BRCA1 mutation testing . .;neurological|oncological;age diagnosis indicator eligibility brca dna testing familial breast cancer;searched criterion could indicate breast cancer family high prior probability caused breast ovarian cancer susceptibility locus brca chromosome end performed linkage study consecutively collected dutch breast cancer family including least one case ovarian cancer used intake cutoff least three firstdegree relative breast ovarian cancer age significant evidence linkage found among breast cancer family mean age diagnosis less year unexpectedly low proportion breastovarian cancer family estimated linked brca could due founder effect dutch population given expected logistical problem clinical management brca identified propose interim period family strong positive family history early onset breast ovarian cancer offered brca mutation testing;age diagnosis indicator eligibility brca dna testing familial breast cancer searched criterion could indicate breast cancer family high prior probability caused breast ovarian cancer susceptibility locus brca chromosome end performed linkage study consecutively collected dutch breast cancer family including least one case ovarian cancer used intake cutoff least three firstdegree relative breast ovarian cancer age significant evidence linkage found among breast cancer family mean age diagnosis less year unexpectedly low proportion breastovarian cancer family estimated linked brca could due founder effect dutch population given expected logistical problem clinical management brca identified propose interim period family strong positive family history early onset breast ovarian cancer offered brca mutation testing;neurological|oncological;cardiovascular|hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in F344 rats.;Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats. Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic-induced changes were reversible. There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment. The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage. During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover. This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN. The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla.;hepatorenal;irreversible damage medullary interstitium experimental analgesic nephropathy rat;renal papillary necrosis rpn decreased urinary concentrating ability developed continuous longterm treatment aspirin paracetamol female fischer rat renal structure concentrating ability examined recovery period week analgesic given investigate whether analgesicinduced change reversible evidence repair damaged medullary interstitial matrix proliferation remaining undamaged type medullary interstitial cell recovery period following analgesic treatment recovery urinary concentrating ability related length analgesic treatment extent resulting inner medullary structural damage early stage analgesic treatment change urinary concentrating ability reversible prolonged analgesic treatment maximum urinary concentrating ability failed recover study show prolonged analgesic treatment fischer rat cause progressive irreversible damage interstitial matrix type interstitial cell leading rpn associated urinary concentrating defect reversible early stage structural damage inner medulla;irreversible damage medullary interstitium experimental analgesic nephropathy rat renal papillary necrosis rpn decreased urinary concentrating ability developed continuous longterm treatment aspirin paracetamol female fischer rat renal structure concentrating ability examined recovery period week analgesic given investigate whether analgesicinduced change reversible evidence repair damaged medullary interstitial matrix proliferation remaining undamaged type medullary interstitial cell recovery period following analgesic treatment recovery urinary concentrating ability related length analgesic treatment extent resulting inner medullary structural damage early stage analgesic treatment change urinary concentrating ability reversible prolonged analgesic treatment maximum urinary concentrating ability failed recover study show prolonged analgesic treatment fischer rat cause progressive irreversible damage interstitial matrix type interstitial cell leading rpn associated urinary concentrating defect reversible early stage structural damage inner medulla;hepatorenal;cardiovascular;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance in females with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: report from the Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study.;OBJECTIVE  To examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria ( PKU ) . METHODOLOGY  PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study ( MPKUCS ) . A total of 84 different mutations were detected , and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals . Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations , 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity ( severe PKU , moderate PKU , mild PKU , and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [ MHP ] ) . Then , 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications . The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity . These patients are considered functionally hemizygous . RESULTS  The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level . Cognitive performance ( IQ ) was also significantly related to genotype . The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96 , respectively , whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84 , respectively . Of the patients with PKU , 92 % had been treated during childhood . Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations . Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group . CONCLUSIONS  The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances . Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU . The significant relationship among genotype , biochemical phenotype , and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy . .;neurological;relationship among genotype biochemical phenotype cognitive performance female phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency report maternal phenylketonuria collaborative study;objective examine relationship phenylalanine hydroxylase pah genotype biochemical phenotype cognitive development maternal phenylketonuria pku methodology pah gene mutation examined hyperphenylalaninemic female enrolled maternal pku collaborative study mpkucs total different mutation detected complete genotype obtained individual based previous knowledge mutationphenotype association mutation could assigned one four class severity severe pku moderate pku mild pku mild hyperphenylalaninemia mhp mpkucs subject grouped according various combination mutation classification sample size large enough statistical testing four group least one mutation completely abolishes enzyme activity patient considered functionally hemizygous result biochemical phenotype predicted genotype functionally hemizygous patient related significantly assigned phenylalanine level cognitive performance also significantly related genotype pahdeficient mother severe pku mutation combination mhp mutation mild pku mutation respectively whereas pku mother two severe pku mutation one severe one moderate pku mutation respectively patient pku treated childhood untreated treated late lower average score group mutation combination female moderate mild pku treated early treated year showed score point average group conclusion reproductive outcome maternal phenylketonuria dependent prenatal metabolic control postnatal environmental circumstance factor depend intellectual resource mother pku significant relationship among genotype biochemical phenotype cognitive performance observed present study importance development optimal strategy future treatment female pku plan pregnancy;relationship among genotype biochemical phenotype cognitive performance female phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency report maternal phenylketonuria collaborative study objective examine relationship phenylalanine hydroxylase pah genotype biochemical phenotype cognitive development maternal phenylketonuria pku methodology pah gene mutation examined hyperphenylalaninemic female enrolled maternal pku collaborative study mpkucs total different mutation detected complete genotype obtained individual based previous knowledge mutationphenotype association mutation could assigned one four class severity severe pku moderate pku mild pku mild hyperphenylalaninemia mhp mpkucs subject grouped according various combination mutation classification sample size large enough statistical testing four group least one mutation completely abolishes enzyme activity patient considered functionally hemizygous result biochemical phenotype predicted genotype functionally hemizygous patient related significantly assigned phenylalanine level cognitive performance also significantly related genotype pahdeficient mother severe pku mutation combination mhp mutation mild pku mutation respectively whereas pku mother two severe pku mutation one severe one moderate pku mutation respectively patient pku treated childhood untreated treated late lower average score group mutation combination female moderate mild pku treated early treated year showed score point average group conclusion reproductive outcome maternal phenylketonuria dependent prenatal metabolic control postnatal environmental circumstance factor depend intellectual resource mother pku significant relationship among genotype biochemical phenotype cognitive performance observed present study importance development optimal strategy future treatment female pku plan pregnancy;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Human mutations in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reflect evolutionary history.;"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping X-linked gene whose main function is to produce NADPH , a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions . Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia ( triggered by fava beans or other agents ) or life-long hemolytic anemia . We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene . From the alignment of the amino acid ( aa ) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) species from 42 different organisms , we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved ( 50-99 % ) aa ; relatively few are in fully conserved aa ( where they might be lethal ) or in poorly conserved aa , where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency .

Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the adult rat.;Following status epilepticus in the rat, dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly, and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically, in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus. However, the population has never been quantified, so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis. To quantify this population, the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox-1, a granule-cell-specific marker, was estimated using the optical fractionator method. The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial, and stable over time. Interestingly, the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures, because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures. The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis, although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus. The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.;neurological;stereological method reveal robust size stability ectopic hilar granule cell pilocarpineinduced status epilepticus adult rat;following status epilepticus rat dentate granule cell neurogenesis increase greatly many new neuron appear develop ectopically hilar region hippocampal formation suggested ectopic hilar granule cell could contribute spontaneous seizure ultimately develop status epilepticus however population never quantified unclear whether substantial enough strong influence epileptogenesis quantify population total number ectopic hilar granule cell estimated using unbiased stereology different time pilocarpineinduced status epilepticus number hilar neuron immunoreactive prox granulecellspecific marker estimated using optical fractionator method result indicate size hilar ectopic granule cell population status epilepticus substantial stable time interestingly size population appears correlated frequency behavioral seizure animal ectopic granule cell hilus frequent behavioral seizure hilar ectopic granule cell population appear vary systematically across septotemporal axis although associated increase volume hilus result provide new insight potential role ectopic hilar granule cell pilocarpine model temporal lobe epilepsy;stereological method reveal robust size stability ectopic hilar granule cell pilocarpineinduced status epilepticus adult rat following status epilepticus rat dentate granule cell neurogenesis increase greatly many new neuron appear develop ectopically hilar region hippocampal formation suggested ectopic hilar granule cell could contribute spontaneous seizure ultimately develop status epilepticus however population never quantified unclear whether substantial enough strong influence epileptogenesis quantify population total number ectopic hilar granule cell estimated using unbiased stereology different time pilocarpineinduced status epilepticus number hilar neuron immunoreactive prox granulecellspecific marker estimated using optical fractionator method result indicate size hilar ectopic granule cell population status epilepticus substantial stable time interestingly size population appears correlated frequency behavioral seizure animal ectopic granule cell hilus frequent behavioral seizure hilar ectopic granule cell population appear vary systematically across septotemporal axis although associated increase volume hilus result provide new insight potential role ectopic hilar granule cell pilocarpine model temporal lobe epilepsy;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Germline mutations in the 3' part of APC exon 15 do not result in truncated proteins and are associated with attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli.;Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps predominantly in the colorectal region . Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene are responsible for most cases of FAP . Mutations at the 5 end of APC are known to be associated with a relatively mild form of the disease , called attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ) . We identified a frameshift mutation in the 3 part of exon 15 , resulting in a stop codon at 1862 , in a large Dutch kindred with AAPC . Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from affected family members from this kindred , as well as from a previously reported Swiss family carrying a frameshift mutation at codon 1987 and displaying a similar attenuated phenotype , showed only the wild-type APC protein . Our study indicates that chain-terminating mutations located in the 3 part of APC do not result in detectable truncated polypeptides and we hypothesize that this is likely to be the basis for the observed AAPC phenotype . .;oncological;germline mutation part apc exon result truncated protein associated attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli;familial adenomatous polyposis fap inherited predisposition colorectal cancer characterized development numerous adenomatous polyp predominantly colorectal region germline mutation adenomatous polyposis coli apc gene responsible case fap mutation end apc known associated relatively mild form disease called attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli aapc identified frameshift mutation part exon resulting stop codon large dutch kindred aapc western blot analysis lymphoblastoid cell line derived affected family member kindred well previously reported swiss family carrying frameshift mutation codon displaying similar attenuated phenotype showed wildtype apc protein study indicates chainterminating mutation located part apc result detectable truncated polypeptide hypothesize likely basis observed aapc phenotype;germline mutation part apc exon result truncated protein associated attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli familial adenomatous polyposis fap inherited predisposition colorectal cancer characterized development numerous adenomatous polyp predominantly colorectal region germline mutation adenomatous polyposis coli apc gene responsible case fap mutation end apc known associated relatively mild form disease called attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli aapc identified frameshift mutation part exon resulting stop codon large dutch kindred aapc western blot analysis lymphoblastoid cell line derived affected family member kindred well previously reported swiss family carrying frameshift mutation codon displaying similar attenuated phenotype showed wildtype apc protein study indicates chainterminating mutation located part apc result detectable truncated polypeptide hypothesize likely basis observed aapc phenotype;oncological;hepatorenal|neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Passage of mannitol into the brain around gliomas: a potential cause of rebound phenomenon. A study on 21 patients.;"AIM: Widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon. Leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals. As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients. METHODS: Mannitol (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. Mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that even after a single bolus, mannitol may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP.";neurological|oncological;passage mannitol brain around glioma potential cause rebound phenomenon study patient;aim widespread use mannitol reduce brain edema lower elevated icp brain tumor patient continues afflicted socalled rebound phenomenon leakage mannitol brain parenchyma altered bbb secondary reversal osmotic gradient considered major cause rebound demonstrated experimentally animal contribution issue decided research possible passage mannitol brain administration brain tumor patient method mannitol solution gkg administered bolus patient ten malignant glioma seven brain metastasis four meningioma minute craniotomy resection sample surrounding edematous white matter taken time venous blood sample mannitol concentration measured plasma white matter modified version enzyme assay blonquist result glioma patient mannitol concentration white matter time higher plasma mean time meningioma metastasis patient plasma concentration mannitol higher white matter concentration except three case infiltration neoplastic cell conclusion result study show even single bolus mannitol may leak altered bbb near glioma reversing initial plasmatoblood osmotic gradient aggravating peritumoral edema promoting rebound icp;passage mannitol brain around glioma potential cause rebound phenomenon study patient aim widespread use mannitol reduce brain edema lower elevated icp brain tumor patient continues afflicted socalled rebound phenomenon leakage mannitol brain parenchyma altered bbb secondary reversal osmotic gradient considered major cause rebound demonstrated experimentally animal contribution issue decided research possible passage mannitol brain administration brain tumor patient method mannitol solution gkg administered bolus patient ten malignant glioma seven brain metastasis four meningioma minute craniotomy resection sample surrounding edematous white matter taken time venous blood sample mannitol concentration measured plasma white matter modified version enzyme assay blonquist result glioma patient mannitol concentration white matter time higher plasma mean time meningioma metastasis patient plasma concentration mannitol higher white matter concentration except three case infiltration neoplastic cell conclusion result study show even single bolus mannitol may leak altered bbb near glioma reversing initial plasmatoblood osmotic gradient aggravating peritumoral edema promoting rebound icp;neurological|oncological;oncological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Clinical nephrotoxicity of tobramycin and gentamicin. A prospective study.;Nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually. Gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies. In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside-related renal failure, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. In these 62 patients, no other causes for renal failure could be identified. Five of 33 (15%) of the tobramycin-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the gentamicin-treated patients had renal failure. Thus, gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin.;hepatorenal;clinical nephrotoxicity tobramycin gentamicin prospective study;nearly million people country receive aminoglycoside antibiotic annually gentamicin sulfate tobramycin sulfate continue demonstrate ototoxicity nephrotoxicity animal clinical study study patient confirmed initial normal renal function treated mgkgday gentamicin sulfate tobramycin sulfate minimum seven day followed prospectively development aminoglycosiderelated renal failure defined least onethird reduction renal function patient cause renal failure could identified five tobramycintreated patient gentamicintreated patient renal failure thus gentamicin associated renal failure three time often tobramycin;clinical nephrotoxicity tobramycin gentamicin prospective study nearly million people country receive aminoglycoside antibiotic annually gentamicin sulfate tobramycin sulfate continue demonstrate ototoxicity nephrotoxicity animal clinical study study patient confirmed initial normal renal function treated mgkgday gentamicin sulfate tobramycin sulfate minimum seven day followed prospectively development aminoglycosiderelated renal failure defined least onethird reduction renal function patient cause renal failure could identified five tobramycintreated patient gentamicintreated patient renal failure thus gentamicin associated renal failure three time often tobramycin;hepatorenal;hepatorenal;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Two distinct mutations at a single BamHI site in phenylketonuria.;Classical phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . The abolition of an invariant BamHI site located in the coding sequence of the PAH gene ( exon 7 ) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codon 272 and 273 ( 272gly----stop and 273ser----phe , respectively ) . Both mutations were detected in north eastern France or Belgium and occurred on the background of RFLP haplotype 7 alleles . The present study supports the view that the clinical heterogeneity in PKU is accounted for by the large variety of mutant genotypes associated with PAH deficiencies . .;hepatorenal;two distinct mutation single bamhi site phenylketonuria;classical phenylketonuria autosomal recessive disease caused deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase pah abolition invariant bamhi site located coding sequence pah gene exon led recognition two new point mutation codon glystop serphe respectively mutation detected north eastern france belgium occurred background rflp haplotype allele present study support view clinical heterogeneity pku accounted large variety mutant genotype associated pah deficiency;two distinct mutation single bamhi site phenylketonuria classical phenylketonuria autosomal recessive disease caused deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase pah abolition invariant bamhi site located coding sequence pah gene exon led recognition two new point mutation codon glystop serphe respectively mutation detected north eastern france belgium occurred background rflp haplotype allele present study support view clinical heterogeneity pku accounted large variety mutant genotype associated pah deficiency;hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
Coincidence of two novel arylsulfatase A alleles and mutation 459+1G>A within a family with metachromatic leukodystrophy: molecular basis of phenotypic heterogeneity.;In a family with three siblings , one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) , fatal at age 5 years , with deficient arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) activity and increased galactosylsulfatide ( GS ) excretion . The two other siblings , apparently healthy at 12 ( 1 / 2 ) and 15 years , respectively , and their father , apparently healthy as well , presented ARSA and GS values within the range of MLD patients . Mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different ARSA mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity . The late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1G > A , and from his father a novel , single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 ( 7delG ) . The two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A and , on their paternal allele , a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8 , resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine ( A464V ) . The fathers genotype thus was 7delG / A464V . Mutation A464V was not found in 18 unrelated MLD patients and 50 controls . A464V , although clearly modifying ARSA and GS levels , apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of MLD , mimicking the frequent ARSA pseudodeficiency allele . Our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions MLD-like ARSA and GS values need not be paralleled by clinical disease , a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications . Moreover , further ARSA alleles functionally similar to A464V might exist which , together with 0-type mutations , may cause pathological ARSA and GS levels , but not clinical outbreak of the disease . .;neurological;coincidence two novel arylsulfatase allele mutation within family metachromatic leukodystrophy molecular basis phenotypic heterogeneity;family three sibling one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy mld fatal age year deficient arylsulfatase arsa activity increased galactosylsulfatide excretion two sibling apparently healthy year respectively father apparently healthy well presented arsa value within range mld patient mutation screening sequence analysis disclosed involvement three different arsa mutation molecular basis intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity late infantile patient inherited mother frequent type mutation father novel single basepair microdeletion guanine nucleotide exon delg two clinically unaffected sibling carried maternal mutation paternal allele novel cytosine thymidine transition nucleotide exon resulting substitution alanine valine father genotype thus delg mutation found unrelated mld patient control although clearly modifying arsa level apparently bear little significance clinical manifestation mld mimicking frequent arsa pseudodeficiency allele result demonstrate certain genetic condition mldlike arsa value need paralleled clinical disease finding serious diagnostic prognostic implication moreover arsa allele functionally similar might exist together type mutation may cause pathological arsa level clinical outbreak disease;coincidence two novel arylsulfatase allele mutation within family metachromatic leukodystrophy molecular basis phenotypic heterogeneity family three sibling one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy mld fatal age year deficient arylsulfatase arsa activity increased galactosylsulfatide excretion two sibling apparently healthy year respectively father apparently healthy well presented arsa value within range mld patient mutation screening sequence analysis disclosed involvement three different arsa mutation molecular basis intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity late infantile patient inherited mother frequent type mutation father novel single basepair microdeletion guanine nucleotide exon delg two clinically unaffected sibling carried maternal mutation paternal allele novel cytosine thymidine transition nucleotide exon resulting substitution alanine valine father genotype thus delg mutation found unrelated mld patient control although clearly modifying arsa level apparently bear little significance clinical manifestation mld mimicking frequent arsa pseudodeficiency allele result demonstrate certain genetic condition mldlike arsa value need paralleled clinical disease finding serious diagnostic prognostic implication moreover arsa allele functionally similar might exist together type mutation may cause pathological arsa level clinical outbreak disease;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
The effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I on chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy in rats.;We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy, an experimental model of glomerular disease. Therefore, we examined whether recombinant human (rh) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. The glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of PAN over 12 wk. Experimental animals (n = 6) received rhIGF-I, 400 micrograms/d, whereas control rats (n = 6) received the vehicle. rhIGF-I improved weight gain by 14% (p < 0.05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease. Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. After 12 wk, the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats, 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated PAN nephropathy animals, p < 0.05. The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content. In rats with PAN nephropathy, administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression, without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA. In normal rats with intact kidneys, rhIGF-I administration (n = 4) did not alter weight gain, blood pressure, proteinuria, GFR, glomerular planar area, renal cortical malondialdehyde content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals (n = 4). rhIGF-I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF-I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF-I or GH receptors. We conclude that: 1) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2) unlike rhGH, long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model.;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;effect recombinant human insulinlike growth factori chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy rat;recently demonstrated recombinant hgh exacerbates renal functional structural injury chronic puromycin aminonucleoside pan nephropathy experimental model glomerular disease therefore examined whether recombinant human igfi safer alternative treatment growth failure rat chronic pan nephropathy glomerulopathy induced seven serial injection pan experimental animal received rhigfi microgramsd whereas control rat received vehicle rhigfi improved weight gain without altering hematocrit blood pressure rat renal disease urinary protein excretion unaltered rhigfi treatment rat chronic pan nephropathy inulin clearance higher rhigfitreated rat versus mlmin body weight untreated pan nephropathy animal improvement gfr associated enhanced glomerular hypertrophy increased segmental glomerulosclerosis tubulointerstitial injury renal cortical malondialdehyde content rat pan nephropathy administration rhigfi increased igfi receptor gene expression without altering steady state level igfi receptor mrna normal rat intact kidney rhigfi administration alter weight gain blood pressure proteinuria gfr glomerular planar area renal cortical malondialdehyde content glomerular tubulointerstitial damage compared untreated animal rhigfi treatment reduced steady state renal igfi mrna level modify gene expression igfi receptor conclude administration rhigfi improves growth gfr rat chronic pan nephropathy unlike rhgh longterm use rhigfi worsen renal functional structural injury disease model;effect recombinant human insulinlike growth factori chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy rat recently demonstrated recombinant hgh exacerbates renal functional structural injury chronic puromycin aminonucleoside pan nephropathy experimental model glomerular disease therefore examined whether recombinant human igfi safer alternative treatment growth failure rat chronic pan nephropathy glomerulopathy induced seven serial injection pan experimental animal received rhigfi microgramsd whereas control rat received vehicle rhigfi improved weight gain without altering hematocrit blood pressure rat renal disease urinary protein excretion unaltered rhigfi treatment rat chronic pan nephropathy inulin clearance higher rhigfitreated rat versus mlmin body weight untreated pan nephropathy animal improvement gfr associated enhanced glomerular hypertrophy increased segmental glomerulosclerosis tubulointerstitial injury renal cortical malondialdehyde content rat pan nephropathy administration rhigfi increased igfi receptor gene expression without altering steady state level igfi receptor mrna normal rat intact kidney rhigfi administration alter weight gain blood pressure proteinuria gfr glomerular planar area renal cortical malondialdehyde content glomerular tubulointerstitial damage compared untreated animal rhigfi treatment reduced steady state renal igfi mrna level modify gene expression igfi receptor conclude administration rhigfi improves growth gfr rat chronic pan nephropathy unlike rhgh longterm use rhigfi worsen renal functional structural injury disease model;neurological|cardiovascular|hepatorenal;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659

Thyroxine abuse: an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.;Eating disorders and the associated behavioural problems and drug abuse are uncommon in pregnancy. When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus. This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with eating disorders in pregnancy, including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse. In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with eating disorders and reminds us that when a cause for thyrotoxicosis remains obscure, thyroxine abuse should be considered and explored.;neurological;thyroxine abuse unusual case thyrotoxicosis pregnancy;eating disorder associated behavioural problem drug abuse uncommon pregnancy occur often unrecognized denial significant may pose risk mother fetus case illustrates number problem may encountered woman eating disorder pregnancy including prolonged recurrent metabolic disturbance diuretic abuse particular illustrates derangement thyroid function seen pregnant woman eating disorder reminds cause thyrotoxicosis remains obscure thyroxine abuse considered explored;thyroxine abuse unusual case thyrotoxicosis pregnancy eating disorder associated behavioural problem drug abuse uncommon pregnancy occur often unrecognized denial significant may pose risk mother fetus case illustrates number problem may encountered woman eating disorder pregnancy including prolonged recurrent metabolic disturbance diuretic abuse particular illustrates derangement thyroid function seen pregnant woman eating disorder reminds cause thyrotoxicosis remains obscure thyroxine abuse considered explored;neurological;neurological;BR;xgboost;0.8932509812833659
