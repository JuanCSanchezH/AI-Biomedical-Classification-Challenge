Neural network analysis of brain imaging data for Alzheimer's detection;"
        This research investigates the use of neural networks for analyzing brain 
        imaging data to detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease. We used MRI scans 
        from 300 patients and achieved 88% accuracy in early detection.

Liver function tests in patients with cardiovascular disease;"
        We examined liver function in 150 patients with cardiovascular disease. 
        Results showed significant correlations between cardiac markers and liver 
        enzyme levels, suggesting potential organ interactions.

Novel chemotherapy agents for lung cancer treatment;"
        A new chemotherapy protocol was tested on 200 lung cancer patients. 
        The treatment showed 40% improvement in survival rates compared to 
        standard chemotherapy regimens.

Stroke rehabilitation using virtual reality technology;"
        Virtual reality technology was implemented for stroke rehabilitation 
        in 80 patients. The system showed 60% improvement in motor function 
        recovery compared to traditional rehabilitation methods.
